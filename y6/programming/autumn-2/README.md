## key vocabulary

Here are 10 key vocabulary terms with child-friendly definitions for the **Weather Wizards - Python Edition** project:

1. **Variable**  
   **Definition**: A container where we can store information like numbers or words that we want to use later in our program.  
   **Example**: `temperature = 22`

2. **Sensor**  
   **Definition**: A tool on the micro:bit that can measure things like temperature, light, or movement.  
   **Example**: The temperature sensor on the micro:bit measures how hot or cold the air is.

3. **Output**  
   **Definition**: The information or result that the program shows or gives. This could be on the micro:bit's screen, in the terminal, or through a sound.  
   **Example**: Displaying the temperature on the screen of the micro:bit.

4. **Input**  
   **Definition**: The information we give to the program, like pressing buttons or using sensors.  
   **Example**: Pressing button A on the micro:bit is an input.

5. **Function**  
   **Definition**: A block of code that does a specific job, and we can use it whenever we need to.  
   **Example**: A function to display a message on the screen.

6. **If Statement**  
   **Definition**: A way to tell the computer to do something only if a certain condition is true.  
   **Example**: "If the temperature is over 25°C, show a warning."

7. **Casting**  
   **Definition**: Changing one type of data (like a number) into another type (like text).  
   **Example**: Turning the number 22 into the text "22" so it can be shown on the screen.

8. **Concatenation**  
   **Definition**: Joining two pieces of text together to make a new piece of text.  
   **Example**: Joining "The temperature is " and "22" to make "The temperature is 22."

9. **Button A and Button B**  
   **Definition**: The two buttons on the micro:bit that we can press to control the program.  
   **Example**: Pressing Button A could turn on the temperature warning.

10. **Display**  
    **Definition**: The screen on the micro:bit where we can show text or pictures.  
    **Example**: Using the display to show the current temperature in a weather app.

These terms and definitions should help the children understand the basic concepts they will encounter while building the Weather Wizards project.
