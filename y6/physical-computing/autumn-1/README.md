### ðŸª• Duelling Micros ðŸª•

**Project Concept:**
The Duelling Micros project is an engaging, interactive activity designed for Year 6 students to explore the principles of wireless communication using micro:bits.

>[!NOTE]
>Yes - the original concept comes from *duelling banjos* ðŸ˜ƒ

In this project, pairs of students collaborate to create a musical call-and-response game using their individual micro:bits. Each child will program their device to send specific messages based on button presses, which will then trigger musical notes or melodies on their partner's micro:bit.

**Learning Objectives:**
1. **Understanding Wireless Communication:** Students will learn about radio frequency communication, including how data packets are sent and received.
2. **Programming Skills:** By utilizing the MakeCode editor, students will enhance their coding skills, particularly in event-driven programming.
3. **Collaboration:** The project emphasizes teamwork as students work together to compose music, fostering communication and cooperation skills.

**Technical Vocabulary:**
Students will also learn technical terms such as "packet," "radio frequency," "system," and "communication protocol," which will help them understand the underlying principles of the technology they are using.

**Differentiation:**
- **Less Confident Learners:** They can focus on basic note playing - ensuring they grasp the fundamentals of the project.
- **Average Learners:** These students can work on developing simple call-and-response patterns.
- **More Confident Learners:** They can explore advanced features such as creating melodies.

**Outcome:**
By the end of the Duelling Micros project, students will have developed their understanding of how wireless communication works in programming while also fostering creativity through music. The collaborative aspect of the project will enhance their teamwork and problem-solving skills, making learning both enjoyable and impactful.

This project not only reinforces technical skills but also promotes creativity and collaboration, making it a well-rounded educational experience.

### Key Vocabulary

Here are five vocabulary terms for the **Duelling Micros** project:

1. **Packet**: A formatted unit of data carried by a packet-switched network. In the context of the project, this refers to the messages sent between micro:bits - the children will have been introduced to this in Year Five when they learnt about how the internet works but it will most likely need reviewing.

2. **Radio Frequency**: The electromagnetic wave frequencies that are used for transmitting data wirelessly. Understanding this is key to how the micro:bits communicate - this could be compared with how light works to help the children understand.

3. **Communication Protocol**: A set of rules and conventions for data transmission between devices. This includes how messages are structured and sent.

4. **System**: A collection of components that interact to achieve a specific goal. In this project, the micro:bits and their interactions form a system.

5. **Data Transmission**: The process of sending and receiving data over a network. In this project, it involves sending button presses from one micro:bit to another.

These terms will enhance the students' understanding of the technical aspects of the Duelling Micros project and the concept of systems in programming.
