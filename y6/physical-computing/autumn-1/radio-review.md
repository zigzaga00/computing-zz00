## Radio Review Activities

Here are ten five-minute review activities that focus on radio communication.

These activities require very little if any resources | some require one computer (teacher) and some need none at all.

### 1. **Radio Group Quick Quiz (Teacher's Computer Only)**
- **Setup**: The teacher sets up a micro:bit on their computer with the radio group set to a specific number. The teacher sends a series of radio messages, and students have to guess the message being sent by observing a visual or sound cue (e.g., flash of an LED).
- **Objective**: Students review how radio groups work by guessing which message is being transmitted based on cues provided.

### 2. **Message Relay (No Computers)**
- **Setup**: Create a classroom version of radio communication by having students pass along verbal messages. Assign students as "transmitters" and "receivers." The transmitter whispers a message to a "receiver" (next student), and they pass it along.
- **Objective**: Review the concept of transmitting data from one device to another using radio, but with physical relay.

### 3. **Group Signal Challenge (Teacher's Computer Only)**
- **Setup**: The teacher uses one micro:bit connected to their computer to broadcast messages to different radio groups (e.g., Group 1, Group 2). Each student is assigned to one of those groups (virtually or in their heads).
- **Objective**: Students raise their hands if they are in the group that should receive the signal, reinforcing the concept of radio group separation.

### 4. **Flashlight Radio (No Computers)**
- **Setup**: Assign different flashlight signals to represent different messages (e.g., two flashes = "hello"). One student uses the flashlight, while another interprets the flashes.
- **Objective**: Review how radio sends signals that need to be correctly interpreted by the receiver.

### 5. **Decode the Message (Teacher's Computer Only)**
- **Setup**: The teacher uses a micro:bit to broadcast encoded messages (e.g., using simple numbers for letters), and students must decode them.
- **Objective**: Reinforce how messages are sent and decoded over radio, just like sending strings of data between micro:bits.

### 6. **Human Radio Waves (No Computers)**
- **Setup**: Choose one student to be the "transmitter" and another to be the "receiver." The transmitter moves their hand in a wave, and the receiver has to mimic the exact pattern.
- **Objective**: Explain how micro:bits send wireless data and require accuracy for the message to be successfully interpreted.

### 7. **Silent Conversations (No Computers)**
- **Setup**: Pair up students. Each pair has to communicate using non-verbal signals like hand gestures (each gesture represents a word).
- **Objective**: Review the importance of interpreting "signals" just like micro:bits interpret wireless data sent between each other.

### 8. **Message Match (Teacher's Computer Only)**
- **Setup**: The teacher sends different messages to each group (e.g., "Cat", "Dog"). Students must "match" the message they think corresponds to their group. For example, all students in "Group Cat" raise their hands.
- **Objective**: Review radio communication by showing how different messages are sent to different groups.

### 9. **Radio Freeze Game (No Computers)**
- **Setup**: Choose one student to be the "radio broadcaster." They send "freeze" commands (via a clap or gesture), and the rest of the class must stop moving when they hear the signal.
- **Objective**: This simulates radio messages that must be received and acted upon, helping children understand timing in communication.

### 10. **Radio Passcode (Teacherâ€™s Computer Only)**
- **Setup**: The teacher sets up a micro:bit to transmit a simple passcode, and students guess it. If they guess correctly, they get a clue to a puzzle or riddle.
- **Objective**: Review sending and receiving strings, reinforcing how micro:bits handle wireless data communication.

These quick activities reinforce the core concepts of radio communication, data transmission, and group messaging with or without digital tools.
