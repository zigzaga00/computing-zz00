## **Project "Green Screen Chronicles"**

### **Lesson 2: Editing and Finalizing the Animation**
- **Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Objective**: Edit the green screen animation in iMovie, add effects, and create a soundtrack using GarageBand.

#### **Review (5 minutes)**
- Review the key points from Lesson 1: setting up a green screen, taking stop-motion photos, and capturing clean footage.
- Briefly explain how to import their footage into **iMovie**, apply the green screen effect, and replace the green background with any image or video.

>[!NOTE]
>The green screen footage goes on the top of the timeline whilst the background image goes underneath it

#### **Main Activity (50 minutes)**

1. **Editing in iMovie (30 minutes)**:
   - The children import their stop-motion footage into **iMovie**.
   - Teach them how to apply the **green screen effect**, removing the green background and replacing it with another scene (they can choose images or video clips as the new background).
   - Encourage them to experiment with adding titles, transitions, and other effects to enhance their animation.
   
2. **Adding Soundtracks in GarageBand (15 minutes)**:
   - Have the children create a simple **soundtrack** using **GarageBand**, either composing original music or selecting pre-existing loops.
   - Teach them how to export the soundtrack and import it into **iMovie**, syncing it with their animation.

3. **Final Adjustments (5 minutes)**:
   - Let the children preview their animations, making any final adjustments to the timing, transitions, or sound.

#### **Differentiation**:
- **Less Confident Learners**:  
   Offer additional support with applying the green screen effect and adding a simple background. Provide them with pre-made soundtracks if they find GarageBand too challenging.

- **Average Learners**:  
   Encourage them to explore different backgrounds for each scene, add some sound effects to their GarageBand tracks, and include smooth transitions between their animation frames.

- **More Confident Learners**:  
   Challenge them to layer more complex soundtracks, combine multiple green screen backgrounds in different scenes, and add advanced effects such as slow-motion or zoom in/out in **iMovie**.

#### **Wrap-up and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- Groups present their animations to another group.
- Provide feedback on the use of green screen, creativity, and storytelling. Celebrate their progress in using new techniques.
