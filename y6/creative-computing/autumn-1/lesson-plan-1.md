## **Project: "Green Screen Chronicles"**

### **Lesson 1: Planning and Creating the Green Screen Animation**
- **Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Objective**: Plan the animation, create physical models and backgrounds, and begin capturing green screen footage.

#### **Introduction (10 minutes)**
- Introduce the concept of **green screen**: how it allows animators to replace the green background with any scene or setting they choose.
- Show examples of green screen use in movies or animations to spark ideas.
- Explain the tools the children will use: **iMotion** for stop-motion animation, **iMovie** for editing and adding the green screen effect, and **GarageBand** for creating a soundtrack.
- Let the children choose a theme for their animation. Encourage creativity, but for those struggling, suggest they continue the **Mr Zog** theme - they worked on this project in Year Four.

#### **Main Activity (45 minutes)**

1. **Planning the Animation (15 minutes)**:
   - In small groups, have the children brainstorm their story or concept. Create a simple storyboard with rough sketches and descriptions of what will happen in each scene.
   - Help them think about which scenes will need a green screen background and what models or props they will need to build.

2. **Creating the Models and Filming (30 minutes)**:
   - The children create their physical models (characters, props) using craft materials and set up the green screen.
   - Begin filming their stop-motion animation using **iMotion**, carefully moving the models and capturing each frame.
   - Focus on the green screen setup to ensure the models stand out clearly against the green background.

>[!NOTE]
>Any green in the animation will disappear so make the children aware of this

#### **Differentiation**:
- **Less Confident Learners**:  
   Provide templates for storyboards and guide them through a simpler animation (e.g., focusing on Mr Zogâ€™s next adventure). Pair them with a stronger peer for the technical work.
  
- **Average Learners**:  
   Encourage them to experiment with different camera angles and creative storytelling but keep the number of scenes manageable for their ability level.

- **More Confident Learners**:  
   Challenge them to include more complex actions, use multiple models, and think about how they will use green screen to place their characters in imaginative settings (e.g., outer space, underwater, or on another planet).

#### **Wrap-up (5 minutes)**  
- Recap what the children accomplished so far. Explain that in the next lesson, they will edit their footage using **iMovie** and add green screen effects, titles, and soundtracks.
