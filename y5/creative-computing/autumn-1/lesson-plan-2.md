## **Project: “School Heroes – A Creative Documentary”**

### **Lesson 2: Editing the Documentary**
- **Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Objective**: Edit the collected media using iMovie, and add a soundtrack, titles, and transitions.
  
#### **Review (5 minutes)**  
- Review key concepts from the first lesson: how to conduct interviews, capture photos and videos, and the importance of storytelling in documentaries.
- Discuss the importance of editing to make the documentary engaging and coherent.

#### **Main Activity (50 minutes)**

>[!NOTE]
>Make sure pairs and groups have the same mini i-pad they used to collect the data

1. **Importing Media and Organizing (10 minutes)**:
   - Have students import their photos, videos, and audio clips from their iPads into iMovie.
   - Organize the media into a sequence that aligns with their storyboard from Lesson 1.

2. **Editing (35 minutes)**:
   - Students use iMovie to stitch their photos and video clips together, adding titles, transitions, and basic effects.
   - Encourage students to add captions or text to explain what is happening or highlight key facts about their school hero.
   - Use a photo processing app (e.g., built-in iPad photo editor) to enhance photos (adjusting brightness, contrast, and cropping) before inserting them into iMovie.
   - Add a soundtrack using music created in GarageBand or one of iMovie’s built-in soundtracks.
   - Ensure they preview their documentary and make any necessary adjustments.

#### **Differentiation**:
- **Less Confident Learners**:  
   Peer support can be given along with focusing on basic transitions and using an in-built soundtrack from iMovie.

- **Average Learners**:  
   Encourage them to experiment with transitions, fade-ins, and adding text overlays to introduce their school hero or explain parts of the documentary.

- **More Confident Learners**:  
   Challenge them to add more creative effects like slow-motion or time-lapse sequences and to integrate a more complex soundtrack (e.g., layering sound effects and music).

#### **Wrap-up and Sharing (5 minutes)**  
- Each group presents their progress or the final documentary to a different group.  
- Provide positive feedback, highlighting creative use of media and storytelling techniques.
