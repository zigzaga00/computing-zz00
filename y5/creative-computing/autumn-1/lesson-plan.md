## **Project: “School Heroes – A Creative Documentary”**

### **Lesson 1: Planning and Collecting Media**
- **Duration**: 60 minutes
- **Objective**: Plan the documentary, interview school heroes, and gather media (photos and videos).
  
#### **Introduction (10 minutes)**
- Discuss who the "school heroes" are and why it’s important to document their work.
- Explain the project’s goal: Create a short documentary about one school hero, combining interviews, photos, and videos.
- Introduce the steps: planning, interviewing, capturing images, and gathering content for the documentary.

#### **Main Activity (45 minutes)**

1. **Planning (15 minutes)**:
   - In pairs or small groups, have students select one school hero to focus on (e.g., a teacher, janitor, librarian, class monitor or administrative staff).
   - Guide students in planning the interview questions and deciding which aspects of the hero’s job to capture through photos or videos.
   - Use Word to write down questions and create a simple storyboard showing the sequence of content they plan to capture (interview, tasks, daily routines).

>[!NOTE]
>The pairs or groups will need to have the same mini-ipad in the second lesson so if need be take note of this

2. **Interviewing and Gathering Media (30 minutes)**:
   - Students use the mini-iPads to interview their school hero, asking their pre-prepared questions.
   - Capture photos and short video clips of the hero performing various tasks around the school.
   - Ensure that each group takes a mix of close-up shots, wide shots, and some candid footage.

#### **Differentiation**:
- **Less Confident Learners**:  
   Provide a template for questions and support in writing the interview plan. Have them focus on taking photos rather than videos if they feel overwhelmed.
  
- **Average Learners**:  
   Encourage them to ask follow-up questions during interviews and experiment with different camera angles for their photos and videos.

- **More Confident Learners**:  
   Challenge them to capture more creative or artistic shots, such as using the rule of thirds or taking action shots of the school hero in motion. They could also attempt a voiceover introduction using iMovie.

#### **Wrap-up (5 minutes)**  
- Review the gathered media briefly and discuss any challenges students encountered.  
- Explain that the next lesson will involve editing the media to create the final documentary.
