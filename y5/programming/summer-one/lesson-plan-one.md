## 🧭 **Fair Trip Finder : Balancing the Travel Equation (ML4Kids)**

### 📚 **Learning Objectives**

By the end of the lesson, children will:

* Understand that machine learning can be used to build real-world tools.
* Create and train a basic AI model to classify text into categories.
* Use a trained model in a Scratch 3 project to make interactive predictions.
* Begin to think about how the AI learns and what affects its decisions.

---

## 🕒 **Duration:** 60 minutes

---

## 🧩 **Resources Needed**

* Devices with internet access.
* Access to [https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk](https://machinelearningforkids.co.uk).
* Prebuilt Scratch 3 project (from ML4Kids) with:

  * Backgrounds (e.g. museum, gallery, themepark, fishing).
  * A sprite that asks for input and gives recommendations based on predictions.

Please use the video in our shared area if prefered for teaching input :smiley:

## 👨‍🏫 **Lesson Structure**

---

### 1. 🔍 **Introduction – Real-World AI (10 minutes)**

**Discussion (with slideshow or images):**

* “Have you ever used Netflix, Spotify, or YouTube?”
* “They all *suggest* things for you. But how?”
* Introduce the idea of **machine learning**: A way for computers to make guesses based on examples they’ve seen.

**Scenario**:

> “We’re going to build a mini AI tour guide. It will read what someone types and decide where they might enjoy going for the day.”

---

### 2. 🛠️ **Create & Train the Model (20 minutes)**

**On ML4Kids:**

* Children create a new text recognition project called **Tourism Recommender**.
* Add **four labels (buckets)**:

  * **museum**
  * **gallery**
  * **themepark**
  * **fishing**
* Add **5 examples per bucket**. Guide less confident children with examples.

📌 *Example inputs:*

* Museum: “I like history”, “old bones”, “learning things”
* Themepark: “fast rides”, “rollercoasters”, “so exciting!”

**Train the Model:**

* Children press “Train New Machine Learning Model”.
* Wait while the model trains.

---

### 3. 🧪 **Test the Model (10 minutes)**

**Activity**:

* Use the **Test** tab in ML4Kids.
* Children type different sentences into the box.
* AI responds with one of the four place types.

Discuss:

* “Did it make the right guess?”
* “What could help it be more accurate?”

Encourage exploration:

* Try silly or vague inputs—what does it do?

---

### 4. 🎮 **Use the Model in Scratch (15 minutes)**

**Children open the prebuilt Scratch 3 project *Tourist Info (Easy)*:**

* It includes:

  * Input box sprite
  * Output sprite with speech
  * Visual changes depending on prediction
  * ML extension blocks already connected

**Activity**:

* Children click the green flag.
* Type different inputs to see what place is recommended.
* Watch how the background and sprite change to match the prediction.

**Optional Extension**:

* Add their own speech bubbles, sounds, or reactions for each location.

---

### 5. 💬 **Plenary & Reflection (5 minutes)**

Use guiding questions:

* “What helped the AI guess correctly?”
* “What confused it?”
* “What could you do to improve your model?”

Explain:

* Next time, we’ll see how AI can *go wrong* if it’s trained unfairly.

---

## 🧩 **Differentiation**

### 🔹 **Less Confident**

* Provide pre-written input examples on cards.
* Work in supported pairs.
* Use the test tab only, not Scratch extension if needed.

### 🔸 **Average Ability**

* Come up with examples independently.
* Use test and Scratch together with support.
* Reflect on AI performance in discussion.

### 🔺 **More Confident**

* Create more than 5 examples per bucket.
* Tweak the Scratch project (add costumes, sounds, refine feedback).
* Try adding test inputs that *combine* multiple ideas to challenge the AI.
