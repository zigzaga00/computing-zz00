### Lesson 3: Implementing the Planet Landing with AND Logic

**Objective**: Implement the planet landing using `and` logic to complete the game

>[!NOTE]
>The final project can be viewed [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1061496302/)

#### 1. Review and Introduction (5 minutes)
- Review boolean logic using a [review activity](https://github.com/zigzaga00/computing-zz00/blob/main/y5/programming/autumn-one/lesson-two/review.md
)

#### 2. Modelled Example (15 minutes)
- Show how to make the first portal transport the spaceship to a new background and reveal the second portal
- Demonstrate how to use `and` logic to check if the spaceship is traveling at a specific speed and direction to successfully land on the planet - it will explode if either condition is `false`
- Code example for AND logic with the second portal:
  ```scratch

>[!NOTE]
>Please use the demonstration video in our shared area if not confident with step 2 ðŸ˜ƒ

#### 3. Programming Time (35 minutes)
- The children finish their projects

#### 4. Differentiation
- **Less Confident Programmers**: 
  - Provide access to the example project code to use as a reference for own work
- **Average Programmers**: 
  - Encourage them to experiment with different conditions for successfully landing on the planet sprite
- **More Confident Programmers**: 
  - Challenge them to add additional conditions and logic for more complex gameplay, such as time limits | additional conditions for a successful landing | additional items to collect

#### 5. Wrap-Up and Share (5 minutes)
- Have students share their projects with a partner and discuss what they like about the project

### Final Project Sharing (Optional)
- At the end of the three lessons - if time allows - have a short session where students can present their completed Galactic Lander projects to the class, highlighting the use of Boolean logic (OR and AND conditions) in their games
