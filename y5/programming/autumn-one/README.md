# fish eating game | using a variable inside a loop to govern the loops termination

🐱 in this project the children will create a game in which a cat has to eat fish 🐱

🐟 the end of the game will be determined by a timer which uses a variable to govern the end of the loop 🐟

🐡 there will be scope to extend with a loop to keep track of lives and other more advanced features 🐡

## key vocabulary

Here is a list of key vocabulary children will need to understand and work on the fish catching game project in Scratch:

1. **Sprite**
   - The characters or objects in the game (e.g., the cat and fish).

2. **Stage**
   - The background area where the sprites move and interact.

3. **X Coordinate**
   - The horizontal position of a sprite on the stage. Values range from -240 (left) to 240 (right).

4. **Y Coordinate**
   - The vertical position of a sprite on the stage. Values range from -180 (bottom) to 180 (top).

5. **Variable**
   - A storage container for values that can change, such as score or timer.

6. **Clone**
   - A copy of a sprite that can be created and controlled independently.

7. **Forever Loop**
   - A loop that repeats indefinitely until the game stops.

8. **Repeat Until Loop**
   - A loop that repeats until a specified condition is met.

9. **If Block**
   - A block that runs the code inside it only if a specified condition is true.

10. **If Else Block**
    - A block that runs one set of code if the condition is true and another set of code if the condition is false.

11. **Condition**
    - A statement that can be either true or false, used in if blocks to control decisions.

12. **Broadcast**
    - A message sent through the Scratch program to trigger actions in other scripts.

13. **Touching**
    - A sensing block used to detect when one sprite is touching another sprite or the edge.

14. **Costume**
    - Different appearances or outfits for a sprite.

15. **Change X by**
    - A block that moves the sprite horizontally by a specified amount.

16. **Change Y by**
    - A block that moves the sprite vertically by a specified amount.

17. **Set Variable to**
    - A block that assigns a specific value to a variable.

18. **Change Variable by**
    - A block that changes the value of a variable by a specified amount.

19. **Delete this Clone**
    - A block that removes the clone from the stage.

20. **Game Over**
    - The end state of the game, usually when the timer reaches zero or another end condition is met.

### Example Sentences Using Vocabulary

- "To move the cat sprite up and down, we use the **Y Coordinate**."
- "Each time a fish clone touches the cat, it should **delete this clone** and **change the score by** 1."
- "We will use a **variable** called timer to keep track of how much time is left in the game."
- "When the **timer** reaches 0, the **game over** message will be **broadcasted** to all sprites."
- "The fish sprites will appear as **clones** and move across the screen using **change X by** blocks."

This vocabulary list will help children understand the concepts and terms needed to create and enhance their fish catching game project in Scratch.
