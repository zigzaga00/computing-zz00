# space lander - galactic touchdown! | using boolean logic | `or` `and`

ðŸš€ in this project the children will create a game in which a spaceship must use a portal to return to its home planet before landing safely on the planet ðŸš€

ðŸŒŽ the progress of the game and the end state of the game will be determined using boolean logic | specifically `or` `and` ðŸŒŽ

## key vocabulary

Here is a list of key vocabulary that children will need to understand and successfully complete their Space Adventure projects using Boolean logic (AND and OR):

1. **Sprite**
   - A character or object in Scratch that performs actions.
2. **Backdrop**
   - The background image of the Scratch stage.
3. **Block**
   - A programming command or statement in Scratch.
4. **Script**
   - A sequence of blocks that control a spriteâ€™s actions.
5. **Condition**
   - A statement that is checked to be true or false.
6. **Boolean Logic**
   - A form of algebra in which all values are either true or false.
7. **OR Logic**
   - A Boolean operation where the result is true if at least one condition is true.
8. **AND Logic**
   - A Boolean operation where the result is true only if all conditions are true.
9. **Variable**
    - A placeholder for a value that can change, such as a score or speed.
10. **If Block**
    - A block that checks if a condition is true and runs code based on that condition.
11. **If-Else Block**
    - A block that checks if a condition is true and runs one set of code if it is true, and another set if it is false.
12. **Loop**
    - A block that repeats a sequence of commands.
13. **Event**
    - An action or occurrence that triggers scripts to run, such as clicking a green flag or receiving a broadcast.
14. **Broadcast**
    - A message sent to trigger scripts in other sprites.
15. **Operator**
    - A block that performs arithmetic operations or compares values.
16. **Direction**
    - The angle at which a sprite is pointed.
17. **Random**
    - A function that generates a number within a specified range, used to place items unpredictably.
18. **Touching**
    - A condition that checks if one sprite is in contact with another sprite or the edge of the stage.
19. **Hide/Show**
    - Blocks that make a sprite invisible or visible.
20. **Stage**
    - The area where sprites perform their actions in Scratch.
21. **Portal**
    - An element in the game that transports the spaceship to another part of the stage or to a new backdrop.

These vocabulary terms will help students understand the key concepts and instructions as they work on their Space Lander projects.
