Here are five fun and short review activities to help children review their learning about Boolean logic, specifically the concepts of AND and OR:

### 1. **Boolean Bingo**
- **Materials**: Bingo cards with different simple statements or conditions, markers.
- **Activity**: Create Bingo cards with squares containing statements like "It is sunny AND warm" or "I like ice cream OR pizza." Call out different combinations of conditions (e.g., "It is sunny" and "It is warm"), and the children mark the corresponding squares if the condition is true. The first to get a line or full card shouts "Boolean Bingo!"

### 2. **True or False Flashcards**
- **Materials**: Flashcards with simple statements or conditions.
- **Activity**: Create flashcards with statements like "A cat AND a dog are animals" or "A fish OR a bird can fly." Hold up each flashcard, and children have to decide if the statement is true or false. They can respond by holding up cards with "True" or "False" written on them.

### 3. **Human Venn Diagram**
- **Materials**: Two large hula hoops or circles made from rope.
- **Activity**: Place two hula hoops on the ground overlapping to create a Venn diagram. Label one hoop "Likes chocolate" and the other "Likes vanilla." Ask children to stand in the correct section based on their preferences. Discuss how those in the overlapping section represent "Likes chocolate AND vanilla," while those in either circle but not the overlap represent "Likes chocolate OR vanilla."

### 4. **Logical Treasure Hunt**
- **Materials**: Small treasures or treats, clue cards with Boolean logic statements.
- **Activity**: Hide small treasures around the room. Give children clue cards with statements like "The treasure is under something soft AND blue" or "The treasure is near something round OR tall." Children use these clues to find the treasures, applying their understanding of AND and OR.

### 5. **Boolean Simon Says**
- **Materials**: None.
- **Activity**: Play a variation of Simon Says using Boolean logic. For example, "Simon says jump AND clap" means they should do both actions, while "Simon says jump OR clap" means they can choose either action. This helps children practice combining conditions in a fun and active way.

### Key Points to Emphasize

- **AND** means both conditions must be true.
- **OR** means at least one condition must be true.
- Using real-life examples makes abstract concepts easier to understand.
- Encourage children to explain their reasoning to reinforce their understanding.
