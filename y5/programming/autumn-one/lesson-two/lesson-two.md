### Lesson 2: Avoiding Obstacles and Using the First Portal

**Objective**: Implement obstacle avoidance using `or` logic and make the first portal functional using `and` logic

#### 1. Review and Introduction (10 minutes)
- Review Boolean logic `and` and `or` using an activity from the [review activities]()
- Introduce the new goal by playing through the [example project]() - avoid obstacles and use the portal to move the game on if a condition is met

#### 2. Modeled Programming to Get Obstacles and Portal Working (10 minutes)
- Add obstacle sprites to the project
- Show how to make the spaceship bounce off the obstacles using `or` logic
- Demonstrate how to use `and` logic along with a new backdrop to make the portal functional (e.g., spaceship can pass through if it has any amount of crystals of any colour)

>Please use the demonstration video in our shared area if not feeling confident with this stage of the lesson :smiley:

#### 3. Programming Time (40 minutes)
- The children code their projects

#### 4. Differentiation
- **Less Confident Programmers**: 
  - Focus on using two obstacles instead of three
  - Leave the portal as developed in the first lesson - red `or` blue crystal with corresponding variables
- **Average Programmers**: 
  - Encourage them to create three obstacle sprites and experiment with obstacle movement
  - Use one variable called `crystals` to control how the portal works - this requires refactoring original project and code for the portal sprite
- **More Confident Programmers**: 
  - Challenge them to add more complex movement patterns for obstacles and additional items to collect in additon to the crystals - this will impact the code on the portal sprite
