Here are some 5-minute review activities to help children reinforce their understanding of using the **broadcast message** and **when I receive message** blocks in Scratch:

### 1. Broadcast and Receive Relay
**Activity**: 
- Have students form small groups.
- Each group chooses one student to be the "broadcaster" and the others to be "receivers."
- The broadcaster claps their hands (broadcasts the message), and the receivers perform an action (like jumping or spinning) when they hear the clap.
**Purpose**: 
- This physical activity mimics how broadcasting a message triggers an action in receivers.

### 2. Flashcard Quiz
**Activity**:
- Prepare flashcards with different Scratch blocks, including **broadcast** and **when I receive** blocks.
- Show a flashcard to the class and ask what the block does.
- When you show a broadcast block, ask what kind of message they might send and what should happen when it's received.
**Purpose**: 
- Reinforces recognition and understanding of the blocks.

### 3. Mini Debugging Challenge
**Activity**:
- Show a simple Scratch script on the board where a broadcast message is sent, but the corresponding "when I receive" block is missing or incorrect.
- Ask the children to identify and explain the problem.
**Purpose**: 
- Helps children understand the importance of matching broadcast and receive blocks correctly.

### 4. Broadcast Chain Game
**Activity**:
- In Scratch, create a simple project where sprites pass a message along in a sequence.
- Ask each child to program a sprite to broadcast a message and another to act on receiving it, forming a chain reaction.
- Run the program and see if the message passes through all the sprites.
**Purpose**: 
- Demonstrates the flow of messages through broadcast and receive blocks.

### 5. Interactive Storytelling
**Activity**:
- Start a story by broadcasting a message (e.g., "Once upon a time").
- Each child in turn adds to the story by programming a sprite to respond to the broadcast with a small part of the story and then broadcast a new message.
**Purpose**: 
- Reinforces the concept of sequences and how broadcasts can control the flow of events.

### 6. "Message Match" Game
**Activity**:
- Create a set of cards with different broadcast messages written on them (e.g., "start game", "next level", "game over").
- Another set of cards has actions (e.g., "show sprite", "change backdrop").
- Mix up the cards and ask children to match broadcast messages with appropriate actions.
**Purpose**: 
- Helps children understand which messages might trigger which actions.

### 7. Role-Playing Broadcast
**Activity**:
- Assign different roles to students (e.g., Sprite1, Sprite2) and give them scripts to act out, using verbal broadcasts ("Sprite1 broadcasts 'start dance'") and physical actions for "when I receive 'start dance'".
**Purpose**: 
- Reinforces the broadcast/receive concept through role-play.

### 8. Scratch Trivia
**Activity**:
- Ask trivia questions about the broadcast and receive blocks (e.g., "What block do you use to send a message?", "What happens when a sprite receives a broadcast message?").
- Reward correct answers with stickers or small treats.
**Purpose**: 
- Engages students in a fun Q&A format to reinforce their knowledge.

These activities are designed to be quick, engaging, and effective in helping children review their understanding of broadcast and receive blocks in Scratch.
