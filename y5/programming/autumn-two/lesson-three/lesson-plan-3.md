### Lesson Sequence: Creating a Fish Collecting Game in Scratch Using Clones

**Project Overview:** Students will create a game where a cat sprite moves up and down to collect fish sprites that appear as clones moving across the screen. The game will include a timer controlled by a variable, a score system, and different responses based on the fish costumes.

#### Lesson 3: Implementing Advanced Features

**Objective:** Students will add develop different responses based on fish costumes when the cat sprite touches the fish.

**Materials Needed:** Projects from previous lessons | ideas for development of games.

---

**Lesson Plan:**

1. **Introduction and review (10 minutes):**
   - Review using a variable inside a loop to govern the loops termination | [review activities](review.md).
   - Introduce the concept of developing the game by sharing ideas | there is no need to solve these problems as the children will be doing this during the lesson | an example start point is provided in the video in the shared area as this will most probably be needed before the children can succeed at developing their projects ðŸ˜ƒ
   - A bullet pointed list of development ideas which could be provided to the children once they start developing their projects is provided in [development ideas](development.md)

2. **Activity (40 minutes):**
   - **All Students:**
     - Add different responses based on the fish's costume.
   - **Differentiation:**
     - **Less Confident Programmers:**
       - Focus on basic collision detection and scoring | get a different score for each fish costume.
     - **Average Ability Programmers:**
       - Get different fish costumes to decrement and increment the score | increment and decrement the timer | move at different speeds.
     - **More Confident Programmers:**
       - Implement different responses as for average programmers but with additional ideas either of their own or as suggestions special random events such as double points period or extra fish spawning period

3. **Review and Sharing (10 minutes):**
   - Share projects and celebrate the progress made.

These lessons will guide children through the process of creating a fun and interactive game while learning about using variables to control the timing and termination of loops. The differentiation ensures that all students can engage with the content at an appropriate level of challenge.
