Here are five short, fun, and engaging activities to help children review their understanding of using a variable in a loop to govern the loop's termination:

### 1. **Loop Countdown**

**Materials**: Whiteboard and marker.

**Activity**: Write a simple loop on the whiteboard with a variable controlling the loop (e.g., `repeat until (counter = 0)`). Have the children count down from a given number, decrementing by 1 each time, and say "stop" when the counter reaches 0. This helps them visualize how the loop runs until the variable condition is met.

### 2. **Variable Loop Race**

**Materials**: A small toy or object.

**Activity**: In a circle, children pass the toy around. Start with a variable set to a number (e.g., 5). Each time the toy is passed, decrement the variable by 1. When the variable reaches 0, the passing stops. This shows how a loop controlled by a variable works.

### 3. **Loop End Questions**

**Materials**: Paper and pencil.

**Activity**: Ask quick questions where the children have to determine when a loop will stop. For example: "If we start a loop with a variable at 10 and decrease it by 2 each time, when will the loop stop?" They write down their answers, and then you discuss the correct answer.

### 4. **Simulated Loop with Actions**

**Materials**: None.

**Activity**: Have the children act out a loop. Assign one child to be the "variable," starting at a number (e.g., 5). Other children perform a simple action (e.g., jumping) while the "variable" child counts down. When the variable reaches 0, they stop. This physical activity reinforces the concept.

### 5. **Loop Termination Story**

**Materials**: Paper and pencil.

**Activity**: Create a short story together where a character performs an action a certain number of times. For example, "Sam picks 10 apples. Each time Sam picks an apple, they count down. When they reach 0 apples left to pick, they stop." Have children write or illustrate the story, showing the decrementing variable and the loop's termination.

### Key Points to Emphasize

- **Variable**: A value that can change, like a counter.
- **Loop**: A sequence of actions that repeats.
- **Termination Condition**: The rule that stops the loop when the variable meets a certain value (e.g., when it reaches 0).

These activities are designed to be quick and interactive, reinforcing the children's understanding of how variables control loop termination in a fun and engaging way.
