## ðŸ¥³ **Pixel Party** ðŸ¥³

**Objective:**  
The Pixel Party project aims to teach children how to program animations on the micro:bit using its LED display. Through this project, students will learn about creating simple animations, incorporating creativity, and understanding the basics of programming in a fun and engaging way.

### Key Components of the Project:

1. **Using the LED Display:**
   - Students will use the micro:bit's 5x5 LED grid, learning how to control individual LEDs to create images and patterns.
   - They will explore how to represent simple graphics where each LED can be turned on or off.

2. **Animation Basics:**
   - Students will learn the fundamentals of animation, including the concept of frames and frame rates.
   - They will understand how to create a sequence of images (frames) that, when displayed in rapid succession, create the illusion of movement.

3. **Creating Simple Animations:**
   - Students will program a series of frames for animations such as:
     - A jumping character
     - A rocket launching and exploding
   - They will use the micro:bit's programming environment (such as MakeCode) to develop and test their animations.

4. **Iterative Design:**
   - Encouragement of creativity through iterative design, allowing students to refine their animations based on feedback and personal preference.
   - Opportunities to collaborate with peers and share creations, enhancing the social aspect of learning.

5. **Differentiation:**
   - Activities tailored to varying levels of coding experience:
     - **Less Confident Programmers:** Guided instructions with pre-made frames to modify.
     - **Average Programmers:** Opportunities to create original frames with some guidance.
     - **More Confident Programmers:** Freedom to design complex animations, incorporating multiple characters or scenes.

### Learning Outcomes:

- **Programming Skills:** Students will gain experience with block-based programming, understanding loops, functions, and conditional statements.
- **Problem-Solving:** Through debugging and refining their animations, students will enhance their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- **Creativity and Expression:** The project encourages creative expression, allowing students to personalize their animations and share them with peers.
- **Technical Understanding:** Children will develop a basic understanding of how digital displays work and how programming can control physical devices.

### Key Vocabulary:

Hereâ€™s a list of key vocabulary terms relevant to the Pixel Party project that children can learn and understand, along with simple definitions suitable for Year 6 students:

### Key Vocabulary Terms

1. **Animation**
   - **Definition:** A series of images displayed in sequence to create the illusion of movement.

2. **Frame**
   - **Definition:** A single image in an animation sequence. A series of frames creates the full animation.

3. **LED (Light Emitting Diode)**
   - **Definition:** A small light source on the micro:bit that can be turned on or off to create visual displays.

4. **Pixel**
   - **Definition:** The smallest unit of a digital image or display. Each LED on the micro:bit represents a pixel.

5. **Output**
    - **Definition:** Data or signals sent from a device to display information, like the light from LEDs.

By integrating these vocabulary terms into the Pixel Party project, students will build a solid foundation for understanding both programming and digital media concepts.

### Conclusion:

The Pixel Party project combines technical skills with creativity, providing a solid foundation in programming and physical computing concepts. By using the micro:bit to create animations, students will engage in a fun and interactive learning experience that promotes collaboration, critical thinking, and digital literacy.
