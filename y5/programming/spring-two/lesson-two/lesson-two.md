### **Shape-O-Rama: Pattern Party!**

**Objective:**  
By the end of this three-lesson project, students will be able to create patterns and shapes using functions without parameters. They will learn how to make their projects interactive, allowing users to influence the generated patterns.

### **Lesson 2: Combining Functions to Create Complex Patterns**

**Duration:** 1 Hour

**Objectives:**  
- Combine multiple functions to create complex patterns.
- Experiment with different shapes and loops to develop intricate designs.

**Activities:**

1. **Review and Introduction (15 minutes)**
   - Review how to use functions along with why we use them - please see the [function review activities](https://github.com/zig-zaga/zz/blob/main/y5/spring-2/programming/Shape-O-Rama%20%3A%20Pattern%20Party!/lesson-two/function-review-activities.md)
   - Introduce the concept of combining functions to create more complex patterns - please use the *introduction* video in our shared area which shows this if not confident with it :smiley:

2. **Pattern Creation Challenge (40 minutes)**
   - Show students how they can use their existing functions to create complex patterns by combining shapes - please use the *demonstration* video in our shared area if not confident with this and consider letting the *more confident* programmers independently watch the *extension* video instead of the *demonstration* one 👍
   - Students have a go at creating patterns - encourage students to explore different loop structures to see how they affect the overall pattern.

3. **Wrap-Up and Sharing (5 minutes)**
   - Students share their patterns with the class.
   - Discuss what worked well and what could be improved.

**Differentiation:**
- **Less Confident:** Pair with a peer for collaboration and support | Provide an example pattern generating algorithm - the children can use different functions in it so different shapes are used
- **Average Confidence:** Focus on creating a cohesive pattern using two or three shapes.
- **More Confident:** Experiment with more complex loop structures - examples include *using variables to control loop behaviour* which can create spiral effects | using *conditional logic* inside loops to change patterns for example using *shape x* when a loop counter is odd and *shape y* when it is even.

>[!TIP]
>Let the *more confident* programmers watch the *extension* video in our shared area whilst the rest of the class are either watching a live demonstration or a video at the start of Activity 2
