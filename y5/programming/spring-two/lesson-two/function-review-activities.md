Here are 10 fun and interactive review activities, each lasting about 5 minutes, to help children review *how and why to use functions* in code.

>[!NOTE]
>The functions used in these activities *do not* include arguments or parameters

### 1. **Function Matching Game**
   - **Objective:** Match function names with their purpose.
   - **Activity:** Create cards with function names (e.g., `drawSquare`, `jumpCharacter`) and another set with descriptions of what these functions do. Mix them up and have children match the function to its correct description. 

### 2. **Function Pictionary**
   - **Objective:** Identify the function based on drawings.
   - **Activity:** One child draws an action or shape that represents what a function does (e.g., drawing a square for `drawSquare`), while the other children guess which function is being represented.

### 3. **Function Relay**
   - **Objective:** Pass the baton to complete a sequence of function calls.
   - **Activity:** Children form teams, and each child is given a piece of paper with a function name. They must "run" to a board and write their function in the correct sequence to complete a task (like creating a pattern). The first team to correctly complete the sequence wins.

### 4. **Function Bingo**
   - **Objective:** Identify when a specific function is called.
   - **Activity:** Create bingo cards with function names. As you describe or show code snippets that call these functions, children mark them on their cards. The first to get a bingo wins.

### 5. **Function Charades**
   - **Objective:** Act out what a function does.
   - **Activity:** A child acts out what a function does without speaking (e.g., pretending to "jump" for a `jumpCharacter` function). The other children guess which function it is. 

### 6. **Function Detective**
   - **Objective:** Find the missing function.
   - **Activity:** Provide a piece of code with a missing function call and have the children figure out which function is missing and where it should go in the code to make it work properly.

### 7. **Function Memory Challenge**
   - **Objective:** Recall functions and their effects.
   - **Activity:** Show children a sequence of function calls, then hide them and ask the children to recall the order of the functions and what each one does. 

### 8. **Function Quiz Show**
   - **Objective:** Answer questions about functions.
   - **Activity:** Set up a quiz with quick questions about functions (e.g., "What does the `drawCircle` function do?"). Children can answer individually or in teams, with points awarded for correct answers.

### 9. **Function Jigsaw Puzzle**
   - **Objective:** Assemble a complete code sequence.
   - **Activity:** Provide children with cut-up snippets of code, each containing a function call. They must piece them together in the correct order to complete a task (e.g., drawing a pattern).

### 10. **Function Dance**
   - **Objective:** Understand sequencing of functions through movement.
   - **Activity:** Assign each child a "function" (a specific dance move). Call out a sequence of functions, and the children must perform the moves in the correct order. This helps them understand how functions are executed sequentially in code. 

These activities are designed to reinforce the concept of functions in a fun and engaging way, while also encouraging collaboration and critical thinking.
