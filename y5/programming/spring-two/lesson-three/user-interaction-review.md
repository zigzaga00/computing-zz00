## Teacher Uses a Computer

Here are 10 review activities that help children review how to add user interaction to Scratch projects, where the children don't use computers, but the teacher does:

### 1. **Interactive Story Role-Play**
   - **Activity**: The teacher describes a simple interactive story and asks the children to vote on what should happen next by raising their hands for different options (e.g., "Press space to go left or right arrow to go right"). The teacher then acts out the choice in Scratch.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 2. **Guess the Code**
   - **Activity**: The teacher explains a scenario (e.g., "What happens when the green flag is clicked?") and describes different blocks of code. The children guess which blocks will trigger user interaction, and the teacher runs the code in Scratch to show the outcome.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 3. **Code Puzzle**
   - **Activity**: The teacher prepares printouts of blocks of code related to user interaction (e.g., "when [key] pressed," "when this sprite clicked") and asks the children to arrange them into a sequence on a whiteboard or table to form a complete interaction.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 4. **Hand Signal Commands**
   - **Activity**: The teacher assigns different hand signals for different Scratch blocks (e.g., thumbs up for "when [key] pressed"). The teacher then describes a project, and the children use hand signals to indicate which blocks would be used.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 5. **Interactive Quiz**
   - **Activity**: The teacher creates an interactive quiz on Scratch that uses user inputs (e.g., key presses) to answer questions. The children answer by raising their hands or using small cards, and the teacher inputs the answers into Scratch to see the results.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 6. **"What If" Scenarios**
   - **Activity**: The teacher describes different "what if" scenarios (e.g., "What if we press the up arrow now?") related to user interaction. The children predict what will happen, and the teacher tests it live on Scratch.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 7. **Interactive Soundboard Demo**
   - **Activity**: The teacher creates a soundboard in Scratch and assigns each child a specific sound or key. The teacher then "plays" the soundboard based on the childrenâ€™s responses, showing how user interaction works.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 8. **Button Press Relay**
   - **Activity**: The teacher creates a simple project where different keys do different things (e.g., make the sprite move or change color). The children take turns "pressing" keys by calling them out, and the teacher executes the commands on Scratch.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 9. **Action Prediction**
   - **Activity**: The teacher shows a short video or animation made in Scratch and pauses before a user interaction occurs (e.g., before a sprite moves when clicked). The children predict what interaction will happen next, and the teacher continues the animation to see if they were right.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 10. **Function Guessing Game**
   - **Activity**: The teacher describes a specific user interaction (e.g., "The sprite jumps when the space key is pressed") and gives multiple choices for which Scratch block or sequence of blocks would create that interaction. The children guess, and the teacher tests it out on Scratch to reveal the correct answer.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

These activities encourage the children to think about and discuss user interaction in Scratch without needing to use computers themselves, allowing the teacher to demonstrate concepts interactively.

## Completely Unplugged - No Computer Necessary

Here are 10 off-computer review activities to help children understand and reinforce the ways users can interact with Scratch projects:

### 1. **Interactive Charades**
   - **Activity**: The teacher acts out different user interactions (e.g., "clicking a sprite," "pressing a key"). The children guess which interaction is being acted out and then explain what would happen in Scratch when this interaction occurs.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 2. **Human Scratch Blocks**
   - **Activity**: Each child represents a different Scratch block. The teacher describes a user interaction, and the children must arrange themselves in the correct order to create the sequence of blocks that would make that interaction happen.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 3. **Interaction Storytelling**
   - **Activity**: In small groups, children create a short story that involves a user interaction (e.g., pressing a key to make a character jump). They then present their story to the class, explaining what the user interaction would do in a Scratch project.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 4. **Hot Potato Command**
   - **Activity**: The children sit in a circle and pass around an object while music plays. When the music stops, the child holding the object has to describe a possible user interaction in Scratch (e.g., "When the sprite is clicked, it changes color").
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 5. **Scratch Interaction Memory Game**
   - **Activity**: The teacher gives a sequence of interactions (e.g., "Press up arrow, then click the sprite"). The children take turns repeating the sequence from memory, adding their own interaction at the end. This reinforces their understanding of various user inputs.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 6. **Interactive Drama**
   - **Activity**: Children work in pairs, where one child acts as the "computer" and the other as the "user." The "user" pretends to interact with a Scratch project (e.g., pressing a key), and the "computer" acts out the response. They then switch roles.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 7. **Question Chain**
   - **Activity**: The teacher starts with a simple question about user interaction in Scratch (e.g., "What happens when you press the space key?"). The child who answers correctly then asks a related question to the next child, creating a chain of interaction questions.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 8. **Scratch Pictionary**
   - **Activity**: The teacher draws a basic Scratch block or interaction on the board (e.g., "when [space] key pressed"), and the children guess what user interaction it represents. The children then explain what that block would do in a project.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 9. **Interactive Bingo**
   - **Activity**: The teacher creates bingo cards with different Scratch interactions (e.g., "click sprite," "press space bar"). The teacher calls out an interaction, and the children mark their cards. The first to get bingo explains the interactions on their card.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

### 10. **Pass the Interaction**
   - **Activity**: Children pass an object around the room while the teacher says different user interactions (e.g., "when the green flag is clicked"). The child holding the object must quickly describe what would happen in Scratch for that interaction.
   - **Time**: 5 minutes.

These activities allow children to actively participate and reinforce their understanding of user interactions in Scratch without using computers, making the learning process engaging and memorable.
