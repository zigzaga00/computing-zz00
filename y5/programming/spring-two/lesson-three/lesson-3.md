## **Shape-O-Rama: Pattern Party!**

**Objective:**  
By the end of this three-lesson project, students will be able to create patterns and shapes using functions without parameters. They will learn how to make their projects interactive, allowing users to influence the generated patterns.

### **Lesson 3: Introducing Interactivity to Shape and Pattern Creation**

**Duration:** 1 Hour

**Objectives:**  
- Introduce interactivity in pattern creation by allowing users to influence the shapes or patterns.
- Refine and finalize the interactive project.

**Activities:**

1. **Review of Interactivity and Demonstration of Ideas (10 minutes)**
   - Review different ways users can interact with Scratch projects - please see [user interaction review activities](https://github.com/zig-zaga/zz/blob/main/y5/spring-2/programming/Shape-O-Rama%20%3A%20Pattern%20Party!/lesson-3/user-interaction-review.md).
   - Demonstrate some ideas for how users could interact with a pattern creating project - please use the *demonstration* video in our shared area if not confident with this :smiley:

2. **Adding Interactivity (30 minutes)**
   - Guide students in adding interactivity to their projects. They can add features like buttons or variables which store input to let users choose shapes and colours, adjust sizes, or change repetition.
   - Encourage students to test and refine their code.

3. **Project Finalization (15 minutes)**
   - Students finalize their projects, making sure the interactive elements work smoothly.
   - Provide time for debugging and refining the design.

4. **Showcase Finished Projects (5 minutes)**
   - Students showcase their interactive pattern generators to other children in the class.

**Differentiation:**
- **Less Confident:** Provide simple interactive options, such as a basic choice between two shapes.
- **Average Confidence:** Allow students to create more varied interactivity options, like selecting pattern repetition or size of the shapes.
- **More Confident:** Challenge students to create multiple interactive options or varied ways to give the input such as a clickable menu as well as answering questions.
