## Review Activities

Here are 10 fun and interactive 5-minute review activities to help children review how to *use a variable in a loop to govern the loop's termination*:

### 1. **Balloon Countdown**
   - **Activity**: Display a balloon on the screen that inflates as the loop runs. Each iteration decreases the counter (loop variable). When the counter hits zero, the balloon pops.
   - **Objective**: Reinforce the idea of the loop terminating when the variable reaches a specific value.

### 2. **Shape Race**
   - **Activity**: Children code a race between shapes (e.g., triangles, squares) that move across the screen. Each shapeâ€™s movement is governed by a loop with a variable that determines how far it goes.
   - **Objective**: Understand how the variable controls the loop and affects the outcome of the race.

### 3. **Loop Detective**
   - **Activity**: Present the children with a short piece of code where the loop termination condition is incorrect. They must find the error and fix it to make the loop terminate properly.
   - **Objective**: Focus on debugging and understanding the importance of the loop variable.

### 4. **Magic Number**
   - **Activity**: Display a number on the screen that changes each time a loop runs. The loop stops when the variable equals the "magic number," which is unknown to the children. They must guess what it is based on how the loop behaves.
   - **Objective**: Explore how the loop variable and termination condition are connected.

### 5. **Loop Quiz**
   - **Activity**: Create a quick quiz where children answer questions about loop behavior, specifically focusing on how the loop variable controls the loop's termination.
   - **Objective**: Reinforce conceptual understanding through questions.

### 6. **Interactive Spinner**
   - **Activity**: Create a spinner that spins based on a loop with a variable. The spinner slows down as the variable decreases until it stops when the loop ends. Children can guess when it will stop.
   - **Objective**: Visualize how the loop variable influences the loop's execution.

### 7. **Pattern Builder**
   - **Activity**: Children code a loop that draws a simple pattern (e.g., a star). The loop runs until the variable reaches a set value. Each child chooses a different value to see how it affects the pattern.
   - **Objective**: Experiment with how different values for the loop variable affect the output.

### 8. **Digital Dice**
   - **Activity**: Program a digital dice roll that runs in a loop, generating random numbers. The loop stops when a certain number is rolled (e.g., a 6).
   - **Objective**: Understand randomness within loops and how a variable can control when the loop stops.

### 9. **Countdown Clock**
   - **Activity**: Code a countdown clock that decreases a variable each second until it reaches zero, at which point it stops and an alarm sounds.
   - **Objective**: Connect the concept of time to loop termination.

### 10. **Mystery Box**
   - **Activity**: Create a loop that adds items to a "mystery box" (displayed on the screen). The loop stops when a variable hits a certain value, revealing the contents of the box.
   - **Objective**: Highlight how the loop variable governs the collection process and termination.

These activities are designed to be quick, engaging, and reinforce the concept of *using a variable to govern loop termination*.
