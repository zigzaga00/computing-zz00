### **Shape-O-Rama Pattern Party!**

**Objective:**  
By the end of this three-lesson project, students will be able to create patterns and shapes using functions without parameters. They will learn how to make their projects interactive, allowing users to influence the generated patterns.

### **Lesson 1: Introduction to Functions and Basic Shape Creation**

**Duration:** 1 Hour

**Objectives:**  
- Understand what a function is.
- Create basic shapes using functions.
- Use loops to repeat shapes and form simple patterns.

**Activities:**

1. **Review of Using Variables Inside a Loop to Govern its Termination (5 minutes)**
   - The children work on an activity from the suggested [review activities](https://github.com/zig-zaga/zz/blob/main/y5/spring-2/programming/Shape-O-Rama%20%3A%20Pattern%20Party!/lesson-1/review-activities.md)

2. **Introduction to Functions (10 minutes)**
   - Explain the concept of a function as a reusable piece of code.
   - Demonstrate a simple function that draws a basic shape, such as a square.
   - Discuss how functions help in organizing code and reducing repetition.

>If the teacher prefers they can show the *introduction video* which is in our shared area ðŸ˜ƒ

3. **Creating Basic Shapes Demonstration (10 minutes)**
   - Show students how to write their own functions to create basic shapes (e.g., squares, triangles, octagons).
   - Encourage students in this demonstration to experiment with loops to repeat shapes and create simple patterns.

4. **Exploration and Practice (30 minutes)**
   - Students practice creating different shapes and patterns using functions.
   - Support less confident students with step-by-step guidance, while more confident students can explore combining multiple shapes - please see below for further ideas regarding differentiation.

5. **Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)**
   - Review the key concepts learned in the lesson - a *function* is a sequence of instructions which have been grouped together to perform a specific job - they let us make sure our code is D.R.Y. as in Do Not Repeat Yourself ðŸ˜ƒ and not W.E.T. as in Write Everything Twice ðŸ¤ª

**Differentiation:**
- **Less Confident:** Provide template project with partially completed functions for students to complete.
- **Average Confidence:** Encourage experimentation with loops and different shapes - angles of turn can be given or a formula provided for the children to work them out for themselves | divide 360 by the number of sides of the shape e.g. for an octagon the angle of turn = 360 / 8 = 45
- **More Confident:** Challenge students to create a pattern using multiple shapes within one function.
