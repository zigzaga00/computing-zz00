## Animate and Interact | Adding Input to Control Animations

⏏️ in this project students will begin to understand the importance of adding ways for users to interact with physical systems via input by programing a micro:bit to display different animations based on input given to it ⏏️

---

### Prior Learning

- Using the led display for showing a simple image
- Creating simple animations on a micro:bit
- Using the buttons on a micro:bit for input
- Using the `radio` commands to create a simple wireless network
- Using `selection` with the `radio` commands

### Key Vocabulary

Here’s a list of key vocabulary for the **Animate and Interact** project, along with definitions:

1. **Animation**  
   **Definition:** A sequence of images or frames displayed in rapid succession to create the illusion of movement on the micro:bit’s LED display.

2. **Frame**  
   **Definition:** A single image or step in a series of images that make up an animation. Each frame shows a different stage of the animation.

3. **LED (Light Emitting Diode)**  
   **Definition:** A small light source used in the micro:bit’s display to show images, animations, and patterns.

4. **Input**  
   **Definition:** A method by which the micro:bit receives data from the user or environment, such as pressing a button or shaking the device.

5. **Button Press**  
   **Definition:** An action where a button on the micro:bit is pressed, which can be used to trigger events or animations.

6. **Shake Gesture**  
   **Definition:** An action where the micro:bit is shaken, which can be used to trigger specific actions or animations.

7. **Event**  
   **Definition:** An occurrence that triggers a specific piece of code to run, such as a button press or a shake gesture.

8. **Sequence**  
   **Definition:** The order in which frames are displayed to create an animation. Each frame follows the previous one to produce movement.

9. **Delay**  
   **Definition:** A pause between frames in an animation to control the speed of the animation and how quickly it plays.

10. **Show LEDs**  
    **Definition:** A block of code in MakeCode that allows you to display patterns or animations on the micro:bit’s LED display.

11. **Basic.showLeds**  
    **Definition:** A function in MakeCode that shows a specified pattern or image on the micro:bit’s LED display. It is used to display frames in an animation.

12. **Code Block**  
    **Definition:** A piece of code in a programming environment like MakeCode that performs a specific function, such as showing an animation or reacting to an input.

13. **Interactive**  
    **Definition:** Describes a system or program that responds to user inputs, such as button presses or shakes, to change its behavior or output.

14. **Iteration**  
    **Definition:** The process of repeating a sequence of steps or frames in an animation to create a continuous effect.

15. **Pattern**  
    **Definition:** A repeated design or sequence displayed on the micro:bit’s LED screen, used to create visual effects or animations.

These vocabulary terms will help students understand and communicate about the key concepts and processes involved in creating animations and interactive features on the micro:bit.
