Here are ten quick review activities, each designed to reinforce how to use the LED display on the micro:bit to create animations. These activities can be done with one computer (if available) or without any computers.

### **1. Animation Charades (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Have students act out different animations. For example, one student could mime a "jumping" animation, while another student guesses what animation it represents.
- **Objective:** Reinforce understanding of different animation sequences and their visual representation.

---

### **2. LED Drawing Challenge (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Give students a piece of graph paper and ask them to draw a simple animation frame-by-frame. For example, they could draw a smiley face that changes to a sad face.
- **Objective:** Practice designing animations on paper, focusing on creating clear and distinct frames.

---

### **3. Animation Sequence Race (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Show students a series of LED frames on the screen for a few seconds each. Then, ask them to replicate the sequence on a whiteboard or large piece of paper.
- **Objective:** Test their ability to remember and recreate animation sequences.

---

### **4. Code Block Match-Up (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Write different code blocks on index cards and have students match them to their function. For example, a card with “showLeds” would be matched with a card describing what it does.
- **Objective:** Reinforce understanding of code blocks used in animation.

---

### **5. Animation Guessing Game (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Describe an animation verbally, and have students draw what they think it looks like on paper. For example, describe an animation of a bouncing ball.
- **Objective:** Enhance their ability to visualize animations from descriptions.

---

### **6. Quick Draw Animation (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Use a whiteboard or large sheet of paper. Ask students to draw a quick animation (e.g., a walking stick figure) in a series of frames.
- **Objective:** Develop skills in drawing simple animations and understanding frame sequences.

---

### **7. Animation Sequence Review (One Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** On the computer, display a simple animation. Pause it at different frames and ask students to describe what is happening in each frame.
- **Objective:** Improve their ability to analyze and understand animation sequences.

---

### **8. LED Animation Relay (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Have students form groups. One student draws an animation frame on a piece of graph paper, then passes it to the next student, who continues the animation on a new sheet. Repeat until the animation is complete.
- **Objective:** Encourage collaboration and creativity in animation design.

---

### **9. Frame Order Quiz (One Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** On the computer, show students an animation with the frames mixed up. Ask them to rearrange the frames in the correct order.
- **Objective:** Test their understanding of the sequence of animation frames.

---

### **10. Animation Speed Challenge (No Computer)**

**Activity:**  
- **Instructions:** Show students a series of frames quickly and then ask them to recreate the animation at the same speed on paper. Alternatively, have them use a timer to draw each frame within a specific time limit.
- **Objective:** Develop their skills in quickly creating and understanding animation sequences.

These activities are designed to be engaging and reinforce students’ understanding of creating animations with the micro:bit LED display. They can be adapted to fit the resources available and the needs of the students.
