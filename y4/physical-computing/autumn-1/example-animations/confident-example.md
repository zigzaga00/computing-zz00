Hereâ€™s how the LED frames could look for the **more confident programmers** creating a **rocket explosion** animation. The sequence starts with the rocket launching, then an explosion, and finally stars or fragments spreading across the screen.

#### **Explanation**:
- **Frame 1**: The rocket is launching from the ground.
- **Frame 2**: The rocket moves upwards, with the same design but shifted.
- **Frame 3**: The rocket explodes, filling the screen with bright pixels.
- **Frame 4-6**: The explosion fragments spread out, eventually leaving scattered stars or fragments across the screen.

The children can adjust the timing of the pauses between frames to make the explosion more dramatic. They could also add more detail or additional frames for a smoother transition from the rocket to the final explosion.
