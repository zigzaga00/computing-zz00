Hereâ€™s how the LED frames could look for an **average ability programmer** creating a **jumping character** animation. The animation consists of three key frames: the character standing, the character in mid-jump, and the character landing back on the ground.

### **Frame 1: Character Standing**

### **Frame 2: Character Mid-Jump**

### **Frame 3: Character Landing**

In this sequence:
- **Frame 1** shows the character standing on the ground.
- **Frame 2** shows the character mid-jump, lifting their legs slightly and moving upwards.
- **Frame 3** shows the character landing, bending their legs as they return to the ground.

The code would cycle through these frames with pauses in between to create the effect of the character jumping.
