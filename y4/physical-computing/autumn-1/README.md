## Pixel Party | Creating Animations with Micro:bits

🖥️ in this project children learn how to create an animation using the led display on micro:bits 🖥️

---

### Prior Learning

- How to use the led display for a single image
- How to use buttons for input
- Using the micro:bit `radio` commands to create a simple wireless network
- Using `selection` with the `radio` commands

---

### Key Vocabulary

Here’s a vocabulary list with key terms and definitions for the **Pixel Party** animation project:

1. **Animation**  
   *Definition*: A sequence of images or frames displayed in rapid succession to create the illusion of movement.

2. **Frame**  
   *Definition*: A single image or picture in an animation. Multiple frames are shown in sequence to make something appear to move.

3. **Frame Rate**  
   *Definition*: The number of frames (images) shown per second in an animation. A higher frame rate makes the animation smoother.

4. **LED**  
   *Definition*: Light Emitting Diode; a small light used in the micro:bit display to create images and animations.

5. **Pause**  
   *Definition*: A short break or delay between frames in an animation. Adjusting the pause time changes how fast or slow the animation moves.

6. **Loop**  
   *Definition*: A part of the code that repeats itself continuously. In animations, a loop makes the sequence of frames repeat over and over.

7. **Pixel**  
   *Definition*: The smallest unit of an image on the screen. Each pixel can be turned on or off to create pictures and animations on the micro:bit display.

8. **Sequence**  
   *Definition*: The order in which frames are shown in an animation. The sequence of frames determines how the animation flows.

9. **Transition**  
   *Definition*: The smooth change from one frame to another in an animation, making the movement look continuous.

10. **Display**  
    *Definition*: The part of the micro:bit where images and animations appear. It consists of a grid of LED lights.

11. **Code**  
    *Definition*: Instructions written in a programming language that tell the micro:bit what to do, including how to show animations.

12. **Image**  
    *Definition*: A visual representation made up of pixels. In the context of the micro:bit, images are created using the LED grid.

13. **Character**  
    *Definition*: A figure or object that appears in an animation. In the project, it refers to the animated entity, like a jumping figure.

14. **Effect**  
    *Definition*: The visual outcome or impact created by an animation. For example, the effect of a butterfly turning into a flower.

15. **Custom**  
    *Definition*: Designed or created according to personal preferences. In the project, students can create custom animations based on their own ideas.

### **Usage in the Project**

- **Animation**: “We’ll create an animation to make our character move on the screen.”
- **Frame**: “Each frame is a different picture in our animation.”
- **Frame Rate**: “Changing the frame rate will make the animation go faster or slower.”
- **LED**: “The micro:bit uses LEDs to show our pictures and animations.”
- **Pause**: “We need to add a pause between frames to control the speed of our animation.”
- **Loop**: “We’ll use a loop to make our animation repeat continuously.”
- **Pixel**: “Each pixel can be turned on or off to create different images on the micro:bit.”
- **Sequence**: “The sequence of frames determines how our animation looks.”
- **Transition**: “We’ll adjust the transition between frames to make the movement smooth.”
- **Display**: “The micro:bit’s display shows our animations using the LED grid.”
- **Code**: “We’ll write code to control how our animation appears on the micro:bit.”
- **Image**: “We’ll create different images to show in our animation.”
- **Character**: “Our character will be jumping or moving in the animation.”
- **Effect**: “The effect of our animation will be how the character moves or changes.”
- **Custom**: “You can make custom animations based on your own ideas.”

These terms and their definitions will help children understand and discuss their project more effectively, ensuring they grasp the fundamental concepts needed for creating their animations.
