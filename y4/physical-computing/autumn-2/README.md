## Nighty Night - Wakey Wakey | Creating a Night Light - Morning Alarm with Micro:bits

ðŸŒ™ in this project children learn how to work with data from input using the light sensor on micro:bits ðŸŒ™

---

### Prior Learning

- How to use the led display for a single image
- How to use buttons for input
- Using the micro:bit `radio` commands to create a simple wireless network
- Using `selection` with the `radio` commands
- How to use the led display to create an animation

### Key Vocabulary

1. **Light Sensor**  
   - A part of the micro:bit that measures how bright or dark it is. It gives a number: a low number means itâ€™s dark, and a high number means itâ€™s bright.  

2. **Input**  
   - Information the micro:bit gets from the world around it, like light levels or button presses.  

3. **Threshold**  
   - A special number we choose to tell the micro:bit when something should happen. For example, if the light is below the threshold, itâ€™s "night."  

4. **Animation**  
   - A moving picture or pattern shown on the micro:bitâ€™s LEDs. It can make the night light more fun and interesting.  

5. **Energy Efficiency**  
   - A way of saving power so the micro:bit doesnâ€™t use too much energy when itâ€™s running, like turning off the LEDs after a while.  

These terms align with the technical concepts in the project but are simplified to help children understand and apply them effectively.
