### **Lesson Plan: "Nighty Night - Wakey Wake"**  
**Objective:**  
Children will learn how to use the light sensor on the micro:bit as input to create a device that acts as both a night light and a wake-up alarm. They will develop their understanding of input-based interactivity in physical systems.  

**Duration:** 60 minutes

### **Lesson Structure**  

#### **1. Review Activity (5 minutes): "Input to a Physical System"**  
- **Objective:** Reinforce prior knowledge about input devices on the micro:bit, specifically accelerometers.  
- **Activity:**  
  - Use one of the [review activities](review.md)

---

#### **2. Introduction to the Light Sensor and Teaching Input (15 minutes)**  
- **Explain:**  
  - The micro:bit has a light sensor that measures the amount of light in the environment and gives a value between 0 (dark) and 255 (bright).  
  - Light levels can be used as input to trigger actions.  
- **Demo:**  
  - Show how the light sensor works by using a torch or by covering/uncovering the micro:bit.
- **Teaching Input**
    - Demonstrate a basic version of the project using the [makecode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/)

#### **3. Practice (35 minutes): Building the "Nighty Night - Wakey Wake" System**  
- **Instructions for Average Programmers:**  
  1. Set a light threshold to differentiate between "night" and "day."  
  2. Create a basic night light that turns on an animation when it’s dark.  
  3. Add functionality to trigger a wake-up alarm when the light level is very high.  
- **Key Questions:**  
  - What light level should we consider "dark"?  
  - How can we make our alarm noticeable when it’s triggered?

#### **4. Independent Practice (35 minutes): Differentiated Tasks**  

- **Less Confident Programmers:**  
  - Focus on creating the night light feature.  
  - Test the provided threshold and observe how the light sensor behaves.  
  - Experiment with changing the threshold value.  

- **Average Programmers:**  
  - Build the full system with both the night light and wake-up alarm features.  
  - Adjust the threshold values for their specific environment.  
  - Add a simple animation to the night light.  

- **More Confident Programmers (Extensions):**  
  1. Use button inputs to dynamically adjust the light threshold for the wake-up alarm.  
  2. Design a more complex and creative animation for the night light.  
  3. Implement energy-saving features, such as turning off the display after a period of inactivity.

#### **5. Plenary (5 minutes): Reflection on Physical Systems**  
- Discuss the importance of sensors like light sensors in real-world devices (e.g., automatic lights, smart alarms, IoT devices).  
- Pose discussion questions:  
  - How does using input make devices smarter or more useful?  
  - What other features could we add to make this project better?  
- Share and celebrate a few children’s projects, highlighting creative or innovative ideas.

### **Resources**  
- Micro:bits (one per child/pair)  
- Torches/flashlights (optional)  
- Written code snippets for less confident children (if necessary)
