### **10 Review Activities for Input on Micro:bit (With Teacher-Prepared Examples)**

#### **Off-Computer Activities**

1. **"What’s the Input?" (Physical Activity)**  
   - Teacher Example: Hold up a real-life object like a flashlight and describe how pressing the button is the input and the light is the output.  
   - Class Activity: Show more examples (e.g., clapping hands → light turns on) and have students identify the input and output.  

2. **"Sensor Detective" (Class Discussion)**  
   - Teacher Example: Show an image of an automatic door. Ask the class to identify the input (motion detected by a sensor) and the output (door opens).  
   - Class Activity: Discuss other systems, like a smoke detector or a car horn, and identify the inputs and outputs.  

3. **"Input Charades" (Team Game)**  
   - Teacher Example: Mime pressing a button and ask, “What could this input be used for?”  
   - Class Activity: Students take turns miming inputs like shaking, tilting, or button presses while others guess.  

4. **"Button Relay" (Hands-On Game)**  
   - Teacher Example: Demonstrate using a toy or micro:bit with a button. Press a button and describe what it does (e.g., “When I press A, the light flashes”).  
   - Class Activity: Pass the micro:bit around, with each student pressing a button and describing what the output should be.  

5. **"Input and Output Matching" (Card Game)**  
   - Teacher Example: Lay out two matching cards (e.g., input: shaking a micro:bit; output: playing a sound) to explain how they connect.  
   - Class Activity: Students match more input cards (e.g., pressing button A, tilting left) with output cards (e.g., displaying a face, showing an arrow).

#### **Activities Using the Online MakeCode Simulator (With Teacher Examples)**

6. **"Press to Create" (Button Input)**  
   - Teacher Example: In MakeCode, create a program where pressing button A displays a heart, and button B displays a broken heart. Share this program on the board or describe it:  
     - *Input:* Button A is pressed.  
     - *Output:* Heart appears on the LEDs.  
   - Class Activity: Students try to predict and discuss what should happen when button A or B is pressed, then test it in MakeCode.  

7. **"Shake It Up!" (Accelerometer Input)**  
   - Teacher Example: Create a program that shows a random number (1–6) when the micro:bit is shaken. Show the code and ask the children what the input (shaking) and output (random number) are.  
   - Class Activity: Students recreate this program, then discuss how the accelerometer works.  

8. **"Tilting Patterns" (Tilt Input)**  
   - Teacher Example: Create a program where tilting the micro:bit left, right, forward, or backward displays arrows pointing in those directions.  
   - Class Activity: Demonstrate the program and have students predict what happens for each tilt. Then let them recreate and test it.  

9. **"What Happens If?" (Debugging Challenge)**  
   - Teacher Example: Prepare a buggy program (e.g., pressing button A shows a sad face instead of a smiley face).  
   - Class Activity: Show the program on the board, and as a group, discuss what’s wrong. Students then fix the program themselves.  

10. **"Input Stories" (Simulation and Imagination)**  
   - Teacher Example: Create a simple program in MakeCode where pressing button A shows a “Zzz” symbol (sleep mode) and button B shows a happy face (awake). Ask: “How could this be useful in real life?”  
   - Class Activity: Students modify the program or imagine similar systems (e.g., a wake-up alarm or a digital pet).  

>[!NOTE]
>The children can discuss the teacher provided examples and orally reconsturct or debug them rather than working on machines as these activities are meant to be quick - if more time is available and wanted then to focus on these in more depth the children could work on the makecode editor
