## üëΩ **Mr Zog's Earthling Adventure** üëΩ

### **Overview:**
In this two-lesson sequence, children will create a stop-motion animation featuring a physical model of an alien called Mr Zog exploring Earth using iPads, physical props, and simple apps. They will take photos using the Camera app, combine them in iMovie to make a stop-motion animation, and then add a soundtrack created in GarageBand. The project will develop sequencing, photography, digital storytelling, and sound design skills. Each lesson is differentiated for less confident, average, and more confident learners.

### **Resources Needed:**
- **Mini iPads** (with Camera, iMovie, and GarageBand pre-installed)
- **Physical Mr Zog models** (playdough, paper, or other craft materials)
- **Props and Backgrounds** (cardboard, construction paper, colored markers)
- **Craft Materials**: Scissors, glue, colored paper, pipe cleaners, etc.
- **Tripods or stands for iPads** (if available) to ensure stability for photography

### **Key Vocabulary**
Here‚Äôs a list of 10 key vocabulary terms for the children to learn and understand during the **‚ÄúMr Zog‚Äôs Earthling Adventure‚Äù** animation project:

1. **Animation**  
   *Definition*: A series of images displayed in sequence to create the illusion of movement.  
   *Example*: Each frame in the animation shows Mr Zog moving slightly.

2. **Frame**  
   *Definition*: A single image in a sequence that, when shown together with other frames, forms an animation.  
   *Example*: The children create each frame by taking a photo of Mr Zog in a slightly different position.

3. **Stop-Motion**  
   *Definition*: A type of animation created by moving objects in small steps between individually photographed frames.  
   *Example*: The children use stop-motion to show Mr Zog walking across the screen.

4. **Transition**  
   *Definition*: A visual effect used to switch between scenes or clips in an animation or movie.  
   *Example*: They add a ‚Äúfade-in‚Äù transition to show Mr Zog arriving on Earth.

5. **Scene**  
   *Definition*: A section of the animation that takes place in a single location and time.  
   *Example*: The scene where Mr Zog meets a dog in the park is separate from the scene of him exploring a playground.

6. **Sequence**  
   *Definition*: The order in which frames or scenes are arranged to tell a story.  
   *Example*: The children arrange their photos in a sequence to show the order of Mr Zog‚Äôs adventure.

7. **Storyboard**  
   *Definition*: A visual plan for an animation or film, showing each scene or key frame.  
   *Example*: The children draw a storyboard to decide what happens to Mr Zog in each part of the story.

8. **Soundtrack**  
   *Definition*: The audio component of an animation, including music, sound effects, and dialogue.  
   *Example*: The children create a fun soundtrack using GarageBand to add sounds and music to Mr Zog‚Äôs adventure.

9. **Background**  
   *Definition*: The scenery or setting behind the characters in an animation.  
   *Example*: The children make a park background for the scene where Mr Zog explores Earth.

10. **Import**  
   *Definition*: To bring files, such as photos or music, from one app or location into another.  
   *Example*: The children import their photos into iMovie to start creating the animation.

These terms will help structure the project and build the children‚Äôs understanding of key concepts related to animation and digital storytelling.
