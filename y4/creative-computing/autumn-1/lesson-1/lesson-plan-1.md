## **Mr Zog’s Earthling Adventure**
### **Resources Needed:**
- **Mini iPads** (with Camera, iMovie, and GarageBand pre-installed)
- **Physical Mr Zog models** (playdough, plasticine, paper, or other craft materials)
- **Props and Backgrounds** (cardboard, construction paper, colored markers)
- **Craft Materials**: Scissors, glue, colored paper, pipe cleaners, etc.
- **Tripods or stands for iPads** (if available) to ensure stability for photography

### **Lesson 1: Mr Zog Arrives on Earth**
**Learning Objective:**  
To create the initial frames for a stop-motion animation featuring Mr Zog using the iPad Camera and iMovie, and to understand the basics of stop-motion photography.

**Duration:** 60 minutes

#### **Starter Activity (10 minutes):**
- **Introduction to Mr Zog and Stop-Motion Animation:**  
  Show an example stop-motion video (using a simple animation from YouTube or created beforehand). Discuss what makes stop-motion unique (using photos instead of drawing each frame). Introduce Mr Zog as a playful alien visiting Earth.

- **Discuss the Scene Setup:**
  Ask the children to brainstorm what setting Mr Zog might explore first when landing on Earth (e.g., a park, a beach, a city). What might he encounter?

**Key Questions:**
- How do you think Mr Zog moves and reacts to new things?
- What props or background would help tell the story of his arrival?

#### **Main Activity (45 minutes):**
**1. Create a Physical Model of Mr Zog (10 minutes):**
   - Children use craft materials to make a simple Mr Zog character (e.g., playdough, plasticine, paper, or pipe cleaners).
   - Less confident learners can use a template or pre-cut shapes to create Mr Zog.
   - Average learners customize their Mr Zog with different features (e.g., eyes, antennas).
   - More confident learners can add details like movable parts or accessories (e.g., a small backpack or helmet).

**2. Set Up the Scene and Take Photos (20 minutes):**
   - Children build a basic background for Mr Zog’s landing area using paper, construction cardboard, or other classroom items.
   - Set up the iPad in a stable position (use a stand or tripod if available).
   - Children move Mr Zog slightly for each frame, taking a new photo each time using the Camera app.
   - **Tip**: Remind them that the smaller the movement, the smoother the animation will look.
   - Less confident learners can take **10–15** photos for a simple sequence (e.g., Mr Zog landing and looking around).
   - Average learners can take **20–30** photos, adding a bit more movement (e.g., Mr Zog waving or interacting with an object).
   - More confident learners should aim for **30+** photos, using small movements and experimenting with different angles.

**3. Import Photos and Begin Creating in iMovie (15 minutes):**
   - Open **iMovie** and create a new project.
   - Import the photos from the Camera Roll.
   - Teach children how to set each photo duration to 0.2 seconds to create a smooth sequence.
   - Less confident learners focus on basic photo sequencing.
   - Average learners can explore adding basic transitions (e.g., fade in/fade out).
   - More confident learners can adjust timings and create multiple sequences for different parts of the scene.

#### **Plenary (5 minutes):**
- **Showcase and Reflect:**  
  Children share their first animation clips. Discuss what they liked and what they might change for next time. Ask:
  - What was fun or challenging about moving Mr Zog?
  - How can we make our projects better in the next lesson?

### **Assessment Opportunities:**
- Observe children’s ability to plan and sequence their photos.
- Listen to children’s reflections to assess their grasp of storytelling and digital editing concepts.
