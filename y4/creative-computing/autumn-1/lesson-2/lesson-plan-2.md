## **Mr Zog’s Earthling Adventure**

### **Resources Needed:**
- **Mini iPads** (with Camera, iMovie, and GarageBand pre-installed)
- **Physical Mr Zog models** (playdough, paper, or other craft materials)
- **Props and Backgrounds** (cardboard, construction paper, colored markers)
- **Craft Materials**: Scissors, glue, colored paper, pipe cleaners, etc.
- **Tripods or stands for iPads** (if available) to ensure stability for photography

### **Lesson 2: Mr Zog Explores Earth and Meets New Friends**
**Learning Objective:**  
To complete the stop-motion animation by adding new scenes and interactions and to create a soundtrack using GarageBand.

**Duration:** 60 minutes

#### **Starter Activity: Reviewing Learning from Lesson 1 (5 minutes)**
- **Recap Last Lesson:**  
  Watch a few animations created in Lesson 1 and discuss what went well.
- **Discuss Next Steps:**  
  Introduce the idea of creating new scenes or adding new characters for Mr Zog to meet (e.g., animals, humans, or even robots).
  Introduce the idea of adding a soundtrack to make the story more interesting.

**Key Questions:**
- How can we make Mr Zog’s adventure more exciting?
- What sounds or music would fit the scenes you created?

#### **Main Activity (50 minutes):**
**1. Expand Mr Zog’s Adventure (20 minutes):**
   - Children add a new scene to their animation, such as Mr Zog exploring a park, meeting a dog, or trying human food.
   - Encourage them to make small changes between each photo to maintain smooth movement.
   - Less confident learners focus on one new action, such as Mr Zog waving.
   - Average learners create a sequence with a new character or a simple interaction.
   - More confident learners experiment with more complex movements (e.g., multiple characters or props moving simultaneously).

**2. Create a Soundtrack in GarageBand (15 minutes):**
   - Open **GarageBand** and choose a template (e.g., Narration, Keyboard).
   - Children record sound effects, voiceovers, or background music for their animation.
   - Less confident learners focus on adding a basic background music track.
   - Average learners record simple sound effects or dialogue.
   - More confident learners experiment with layered sound (e.g., multiple tracks for effects, narration, and music).

**3. Finalize the Animation in iMovie (15 minutes):**
   - Import the GarageBand audio into iMovie.
   - Synchronize the sound with the animation, making sure the timing fits.
   - Add any final edits, such as title screens or captions.
   - Less confident learners ensure basic synchronization.
   - Average learners add text or transitions.
   - More confident learners refine audio and visual timing for a polished result.

#### **Plenary (5 minutes):**
- **Final Showcase and Celebration:**  
  Watch several finished animations as a class. Discuss what makes a good animation and what they would like to create next.  
- **Reflection:**  
  What did they learn about creating stop-motion animations? What sounds were the hardest to make?

### **Assessment Opportunities:**
- Observe children’s ability to plan and sequence their photos.
- Check understanding of synchronization between animation and sound.
- Listen to children’s reflections to assess their grasp of storytelling and digital editing concepts.
