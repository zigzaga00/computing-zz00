## **Lesson Structure:**

### **1️⃣ Introduction & Example World (10 minutes)**  
An example project can be found at [drakoria](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1141239702/)

🎤 *Teacher Talk:* Show an example of the game structure:  
- The world has **three NPCs** in different locations.  
- Each asks a **riddle**—answer correctly to unlock the next NPC.  
- If a riddle is answered incorrectly, the player must **visit the vampire castle and lose**.  
- The final NPC gives a **spell** to defeat the vampire.  
- The **hero can only win if they learn the spell before visiting the castle**.  

👀 *Show an Example Map:*  
- **NPC 1:** A helpful fairy in a forest. 🧚‍♀️  
- **NPC 2:** A mermaid in a lake. 🧜‍♀️  
- **NPC 3:** A wizard in a tower. 🏰 
- **The Vampire’s Castle** is always visible. 🧛‍♀️  

>[!NOTE]
>The video in our shared area talks over the project - use it if you prefer 😃

**Discussion:** What kind of world would you like to create? Who will be your NPCs? What type of riddles could they ask?  

---

### **2️⃣ Brainstorm & Plan (15 minutes)**  
📜 *Group Work:* Children brainstorm and sketch their own worlds.  
✅ What is the **setting** (forest, kingdom, desert, ruins)?  
✅ Who are the **three NPCs**, and what kind of characters are they?  
✅ Where does the **bad character** live, and what does it look like?  
✅ What is the **spell** that defeats the bad character?  

**Differentiation:**  
- 💡 *Less confident:* Choose from pre-made NPC ideas or settings.  
- ✨ *Average confidence:* Invent their own NPCs but use a suggested world style.  
- 🚀 *More confident:* Create **unique** NPCs, a **detailed** world map, and **custom** riddle ideas.

### **3️⃣ Creating the World & Characters in Scratch (30 minutes)**  
🎨 *Hands-on Scratch Activity:*  
Children use **Scratch’s paint editor** to design:  
✔ The **main backdrop** with three locations (one per NPC).  
✔ Three **NPC sprites**, each in a different setting.  
✔ The **bad character sprite** (vampire, dragon, sorcerer, etc.).  
✔ The **bad character’s lair** (castle, dungeon, volcano, etc.) | this needs to be a **sprite**  
✔ The **inside of the lair** for when the player visits it | this is a separate **backdrop** for the **stage**  
✔ The **hero sprite**.  

👨‍🏫 *Teacher Support:* Help children use Scratch’s drawing tools.  

>[!NOTE]
>The children can also import sprites and backdrops which are already available in Scratch.

**Differentiation:**  
- 💡 *Less confident:* Use **Scratch’s built-in** backdrops and sprites, focusing on placement.  
- ✨ *Average confidence:* Draw simple original designs or use Scratch's built-in sprites and backdrops.  
- 🚀 *More confident:* Add **detailed artwork**, multiple layers, or animated features.

### **4️⃣ Show & Tell (5 minutes)**  
📢 *Pairs or small groups present their fantasy world designs.*  
✅ What are their settings and NPCs?  
✅ What will their bad character look like?  
✅ What kind of riddles might their NPCs ask?
