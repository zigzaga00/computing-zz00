# sprite busters | if-else blocks

🔨 in this project the children will create a game which is based around hitting a sprite to score points 🔨

🕳️ the current costume will determine if the user scores points or not - they might even lose points in extended projects 🕳️

## key vocabulary

these vocabulary terms are essential for children to understand as they work on creating their game in scratch

using these terms helps them communicate effectively about their game development process and understand the concepts involved in programming and game design

- **Sprite**: A character or object that can move and interact in the game
- **Costume**: Different outfits or appearances that a sprite can change into during the game
- **Backdrop**: The background scenery or setting of the game
- **Script**: Instructions that tell sprites what to do, written using blocks in Scratch
- **Event**: Something that happens in the game, like clicking the green flag to start or pressing a key
- **If-Else Block**: A programming structure that allows the game to make decisions based on conditions
- **Condition**: A rule or statement that determines whether something happens in the game - it will always either evaluate to `true` or `false`
- **Variable**: A placeholder for a value that can change during the game, such as a score or timer
- **Score**: Points earned by the player for hitting a sprite or achieving a goal
- **Increment**: Increase a value such as a score - typically but not always by 1
- **Decrement**: Reduce a value such as a score - typically but not always by 1
- **Sound Effect**: Audio cues that play during certain actions or events in the game
- **Animation**: Moving images or changes in appearance to create motion or effects
- **Restart**: To begin the game again from the beginning
- **Debugging**: Finding and fixing problems or mistakin the game 😛
