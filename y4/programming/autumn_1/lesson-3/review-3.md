Certainly! Here are some short, engaging review activities to help children deepen their understanding of if-else blocks and conditions in programming. Each activity is designed to take about five minutes:

1. **Code Prediction:**
   - Present a short Scratch code snippet with an if-else block and a condition on the board.
   - Ask students to predict what will happen when the code is run.
   - Discuss their predictions and then run the code to see the actual result.

2. **Fill in the Blanks:**
   - Provide students with a code snippet that has missing parts in the if-else statement (e.g., the condition or the actions).
   - Ask them to fill in the blanks and explain their choices.
   - Review the correct answers as a group.

3. **Condition Sorting:**
   - Prepare a set of cards with different conditions and actions (e.g., "if (touching color red)", "change costume", "else", "play sound").
   - Ask students to arrange the cards to form a correct if-else block.
   - Discuss why the arrangement works and how the condition determines the action.

4. **Quick Role-Play:**
   - Create a real-world scenario where students act out an if-else block. For example, "If it's sunny, wear sunglasses; else, wear a raincoat."
   - Choose one student to be the "condition checker" who decides the weather (condition) and others to act out the result.
   - Rotate roles and repeat with different conditions.

5. **Interactive Whiteboard:**
   - Write an incomplete if-else block on the interactive whiteboard.
   - Invite students to come up and complete the code by adding a condition or action.
   - Discuss their choices and correct any mistakes as a class.

6. **True or False Challenge:**
   - Present statements related to if-else blocks (e.g., "The else part is executed when the condition is true").
   - Ask students to hold up cards or thumbs up/down to indicate if they think the statement is true or false.
   - Quickly review the answers and clarify any misconceptions.

7. **Quick Quiz:**
   - Ask a series of rapid-fire questions about if-else blocks and conditions (e.g., "What does the 'else' part do?", "Give an example of a condition you might use").
   - Have students answer verbally or write their answers on mini whiteboards.
   - Review the correct answers together.

8. **Peer Teaching:**
   - Pair students up and ask them to explain an if-else block to each other, focusing on how the condition affects the outcome.
   - After a few minutes, ask some pairs to share what they discussed with the class.

9. **Mystery Code:**
   - Show a piece of code with an if-else block but hide the condition (e.g., use a sticky note to cover it).
   - Ask students to guess what the hidden condition might be based on the actions in the if and else blocks.
   - Reveal the condition and discuss how it makes sense.

10. **Scratch Mini Project:**
    - Give students a quick task like making a sprite change its costume based on a simple condition (e.g., "if space key pressed, change to costume 1; else, change to costume 2").
    - Let them quickly code and test it on Scratch.
    - Discuss how the condition and if-else block controlled the sprite's behavior.

These activities are designed to reinforce understanding through prediction, hands-on coding, discussion, and peer interaction, making the concept of if-else blocks and conditions clearer and more memorable for students.
