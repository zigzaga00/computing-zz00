### Lesson 2: Programming Using If-Else Blocks

#### Objectives
- Create a game using if-else blocks.

#### Materials
- Computers with Scratch installed or access to the Scratch website.
- Projector for demonstration.
- Students' game plans.

#### Lesson Outline
1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Review if-else blocks and how they work.
   - Students look back over and briefly discuss their game plans.

2. **Activity 1: Watch a Modelled Example (15 minutes)**
   - Students watch a video which goes over a simple whack-a-sprite game.
   - Students get onto Scratch either locally or online - preference for online.

3. **Activity 2: Hands-On Programming (30 minutes)**
   - Program!!!
   - Students are encouraged to work together and learn from each other during this part of the lesson.
   - This is the most important part of the lesson - more time programming means more learning.
   - Try to not be overly helpful - step back and let the children solve the problems together.
   - Use this time as an opportunity to observe how the children are working - assess understanding or misconceptions with questions as the children work: How did you make that happen | what does this do | how will you get X to do Y | have you seen what child A is doing

4. **Wrap-Up (5 minutes)**
   - Students share their progress and any challenges they faced.

#### Differentiation
- **Less Confident:** Get the children to follow their plan and focus on: Using the `Say` command | Including sound effects
- **Average Ability:** Encourage students to think of creative game ideas and code simple if-else conditions - they could focus on: Using the `Say` command | Including sound effects | Including a variable for example a `score` which *increments*
- **More Confident:** Challenge students to add more complex outcomes and interactions - they could focus on: Including a variable for example a `score` which *increments* and *decrements* | adding more sprites and "holes" | using `random` numbers in their `wait` commands
