Here are some short review activities for if blocks that can be conducted in about five minutes each:

1. **Code Tracing Activity:**
   - Provide a small snippet of code containing if blocks.
   - Ask students to trace through the code step-by-step, predicting the output or behavior based on the conditions.
   - Discuss the expected outcomes as a group.

2. **Conditional Statements Quiz:**
   - Prepare a set of multiple-choice or true/false questions about if blocks and conditional statements.
   - Present the questions to students and allow them a few minutes to answer.
   - Review the answers together, discussing any misconceptions.

3. **Fix the Code Challenge:**
   - Present a piece of code containing if blocks with intentional errors (e.g., incorrect conditions).
   - Challenge students to identify and fix the errors within a time limit.
   - Have students explain their corrections and discuss alternative solutions.

4. **Scenario Analysis:**
   - Describe a scenario or problem where conditional logic could be applied (e.g., deciding whether to bring an umbrella based on weather conditions).
   - Ask students to write pseudocode or Scratch code using if blocks to solve the problem.
   - Discuss different approaches and potential conditions that could be used.

5. **Interactive Whiteboard Activity:**
   - Use an interactive whiteboard or projector to display code snippets with if blocks.
   - Invite students to come up and manipulate the code (e.g., changing conditions).
   - Discuss the impact of each change on the program's behavior.

These activities are designed to reinforce understanding of if blocks in a quick and engaging manner, allowing students to apply their knowledge, analyze code, and discuss concepts collaboratively. Adjust the complexity of scenarios and code snippets based on the students' proficiency levels to ensure effective learning and review.
