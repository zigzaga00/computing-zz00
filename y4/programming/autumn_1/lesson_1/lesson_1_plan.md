# Whack-a-Sprite
This lesson is the *first* in a sequence of three which aim to teach children how to use `if-else` blocks in a fun and engaging project.

## Lesson Sequence Overview
The sequence of three lessons will teach nine-year-old students how to use `if-else` blocks in Scratch. The project will involve creating a game where players hit a sprite, and the outcome depends on which costume the sprite is wearing. Each lesson is designed to last one hour and includes differentiation ideas for students with varying levels of confidence in programming.

### Lesson 1: Introduction to `If-Else` Blocks

#### Objectives
- Understand the concept of `if-else` blocks.
- Begin creating a game where the player hits a sprite.

#### Materials
- Computers with Scratch installed or access to the Scratch website.
- Projector for demonstration.
- A3 paper for planning projects.

#### Lesson Outline
1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**
   - Briefly review `if` blocks.
   - Introduce `if-else` blocks using a simple example on the projector (e.g., if a number is greater than 5, do one thing; else, do another).

2. **Activity 1: Explore `If-Else` Blocks (10 minutes)**
   - Demonstrate a pre-made Scratch project that uses `if-else` blocks (e.g., a sprite changes its message based on its costume).
   - During this teacher led demonstration the children are to be asked questions about it to check their understanding and logical reasoning skills | example questions include: What will happen to the sprite when it is wearing x? What will happen when it is wearing y? How do you know this - explain.

3. **Activity 2: Plan Your Game (20 minutes)**
   - Explain the project: creating a game where hitting a sprite results in different outcomes based on its costume - think *whack-a-mole* where a sprite appears from a hole - could demonstrate how a costume could look like a hole i.e. a solid black circle.
   - Distribute game planning worksheets - aka A3 paper - and have students outline their game, including at least two outcomes based on the sprite's costume.
   - Children work in pairs on this - encourage discussions which include key vocabulary.

4. **Activity 3: Sharing and Improving (10 minutes)**
   - Students share their game plans in fours then around the class.
   - Encourage students to adapt their own plans if they like an idea they hear.

5. **Wrap-Up: Back to `If-Else` Blocks (10 minutes)**
   - Students are reminded how `if-else` blocks can make their game plans work.
   - Students annotate their plans with `if-else` blocks if they have not already done so.
