# Lesson Sequence: Developing a Chatbot in Scratch

## Overview
This sequence of three lessons will guide students in developing a chatbot in Scratch that answers questions on a specific subject. The project will help them understand how to use a sequence of independent if statements followed by a final if-else block. Each lesson will last one hour.

### Lesson 3: Enhancing the Chatbot

**Objective:** Students will add enhancements to improve functionality.

**Materials:**
- Computers with Scratch installed
- Example of [final chatbot](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1043346041/)
- Scratch project from Lesson 2

**Activities:**

1. **Review (5 minutes):**
   - Review the use of variables - see the [review activities](review.md)

2. **Enhancing the Chatbot Idea (15 minutes):**
   - Show some ways the chatbots could be improved | use the video in the shared area if not confident ðŸ˜ƒ
   - Give students time to discuss one or two improvements they will make to their chatbots in this session

4. **Sharing and Feedback (40 minutes):**
   - Allow students to develop their projects.
   - Keep hands off as much as possible - ask questions around the room to check understanding and progress.

**Differentiation:**
- **Less Confident Programmers:** Get them to focus on one simple enhancement such as getting the chatbot to use the users name.
- **Average Ability Programmers:** Encourage them to add more than one enhancement | user name and tracking states for example | and test thoroughly.
- **More Confident Programmers:** Challenge them to implement more advanced features, such as tracking states and using lists to store multiple questions and answers | the children will need to learn how to use lists - a video is available for them to watch independently in the pupil shared area.

By the end of these lessons, students will have a functional chatbot that uses a sequence of independent if statements followed by a final if-else block, and they will have a deeper understanding of how to handle multiple conditions in their programs.
