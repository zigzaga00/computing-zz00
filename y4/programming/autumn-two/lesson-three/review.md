Here are some activities to review variables that do not require children to work on a Scratch project:

1. **Variable Sorting:**
   - **Objective:** To categorize different examples of variables.
   - **Materials:** Index cards, markers, examples of variables (written on cards or printed).
   - **Activity:**
     - Write or print examples of variables on index cards (e.g., "score," "temperature," "age").
     - Mix up the cards and distribute them to students.
     - Students work in pairs or small groups to categorize the cards into types of variables (e.g., types of data they store, where they might be used).
     - Discuss as a class why each card belongs in its category.

2. **Variable Pictionary:**
   - **Objective:** To illustrate different variables through drawing.
   - **Materials:** Whiteboard, markers, list of variable names.
   - **Activity:**
     - Write down different variable names on separate pieces of paper or cards.
     - One student picks a card and quickly draws a representation of what the variable might represent (e.g., drawing coins for "score," a thermometer for "temperature").
     - The rest of the class tries to guess the variable name based on the drawing.
     - Discuss the role and importance of each variable in different contexts.

3. **Variable Guess Who:**
   - **Objective:** To identify variables based on clues and descriptions.
   - **Materials:** List of clues or descriptions related to variables.
   - **Activity:**
     - Provide students with clues or descriptions related to different variables (e.g., "This variable keeps track of how many lives a player has left," "This variable changes when you collect points in a game").
     - Students work individually or in pairs to guess the correct variable name based on the clues.
     - Discuss the function and importance of each variable in context.

4. **Variable Storytelling:**
   - **Objective:** To create a story where variables play a role in the plot.
   - **Materials:** Paper, markers, imagination!
   - **Activity:**
     - Ask students to write or draw a short story where variables play a crucial role (e.g., "The Adventure of the Magical Score Counter," "The Mystery of the Changing Temperature").
     - Encourage them to incorporate different types of variables and explain how they affect the story's progression.
     - Share stories aloud and discuss how variables contribute to storytelling and gameplay mechanics.

5. **Variable Riddles:**
   - **Objective:** To solve riddles that involve understanding variables.
   - **Materials:** List of riddles related to variables.
   - **Activity:**
     - Provide students with riddles that involve variables (e.g., "I start at zero and increase every time you collect a gem. What am I?").
     - Students work individually or in pairs to solve the riddles and identify the variable described.
     - Discuss the role and significance of variables in solving problems and achieving goals.

These activities are interactive, engaging, and encourage critical thinking about variables without requiring students to work directly on a Scratch project. They promote understanding of how variables are used in various contexts and reinforce their importance in computational thinking.
