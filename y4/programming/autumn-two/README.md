# animal guru | sequence of independent if blocks followed by a final if-else block

ü§ñ in this project the children will create a chatbot which answers questions on a specific topic ü§ñ

‚òëÔ∏è the sequence of if blocks will check what each question is about | the final if else block catches questions not understood ‚òëÔ∏è

## key vocabulary

Here is a list of key vocabulary that nine-year-old children will need when working on creating the chatbot project using independent if statements followed by a final if-else block:

### Key Vocabulary

- **Chatbot**: A computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users.
- **Condition**: A statement that can be true or false, used to make decisions in programming.
- **If Statement**: A programming construct that runs a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **Else Block**: A programming construct that runs a block of code if the condition in an if statement is false.
- **Sequence**: The order in which instructions or statements are executed in a program.
- **Independent If Statements**: Multiple if statements that are not connected to each other; each is evaluated separately.
- **Final If-Else Block**: The last conditional statement in a sequence that catches any cases not handled by previous if statements.
- **Variable**: A storage location in a program that can hold a value which may change during the program's execution.
- **Ask Block**: A Scratch block that asks the user a question and waits for their input.
- **Answer Block**: A Scratch block that stores the most recent response from the user to an ask block.
- **Say Block**: A Scratch block that makes a sprite display a speech bubble with the specified text.
- **Operator**: A symbol or function that performs a calculation or operation on one or more values (e.g., =, <, >).
- **Interaction**: The communication between the user and the chatbot, often involving input and output.
- **Response**: The output or reply that the chatbot gives based on the user's input.
- **Input**: Information or data entered by the user into a program.
- **Output**: Information or data produced by a program in response to input.

By understanding and using these terms, students will be better equipped to discuss, understand, and implement their chatbot project in Scratch effectively.
