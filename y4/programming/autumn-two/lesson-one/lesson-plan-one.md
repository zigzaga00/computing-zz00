# Lesson Sequence: Developing a Chatbot in Scratch

## Overview
This sequence of three lessons will guide students in developing a chatbot in Scratch that answers questions on a specific subject. The project will help them understand how to use a sequence of independent if statements followed by a final if-else block. Each lesson will last one hour.

### Lesson 1: Introduction to the Chatbot and Independent If Statements

**Objective:** Students will understand how to create independent if statements to check for specific questions.

**Materials:**
- Computers with Scratch installed
- Pre-prepared Scratch project with a basic chatbot sprite

**Activities:**

1. **Introduction and Review (10 minutes):**
   - Review if blocks - see [example review activities](review/review.md)
   - Introduce the concept of chatbots and explain how they work.
   - Show a simple example of a chatbot and how it can respond to different inputs - ChatGPT is a good one.

3. **Demonstrating the Project (10 minutes):**
   - Open Scratch and introduce the project by letting it run for a few questions.
   - The children can answer questions about the code after they have seen it run.

4. **Creating Project which uses Independent If Statements (30 minutes):**
   - The children code a simple chatbot which answers several questions about a topic of their own choosing - maybe an animal, location, period of history etc

5. **Plenary (10 minutes):**
   - Have students play each others projects and discuss what is going well.

**Differentiation:**
- **Less Confident Programmers:** Provide specific questions and responses for them to use.
- **Average Ability Programmers:** Encourage them to think of their own questions and responses.
- **More Confident Programmers:** Challenge them to add more responses using more independent if statements.
