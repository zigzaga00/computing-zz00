Here are some short, five-minute review activities for if-else blocks that can help reinforce the concept for students:

1. **Quick Code Debugging:**
   - Present a short piece of code with an if-else block that contains a deliberate error (e.g., incorrect condition or misplaced else block).
   - Ask students to identify and fix the error.
   - Discuss the correct solution as a group.

2. **True or False Quiz:**
   - Create a set of true or false statements about if-else blocks (e.g., "An else block is mandatory after an if block").
   - Have students indicate their answers by raising their hands or using response cards.
   - Quickly review the answers and provide brief explanations.

3. **Condition Matching:**
   - Write a set of conditions and corresponding actions on separate cards.
   - Have students match each condition card with the appropriate action card.
   - Review the matches and explain why each pair is correct or incorrect.

4. **Mini Scenario Discussion:**
   - Present a quick scenario (e.g., "If it’s raining, take an umbrella; else, wear sunglasses").
   - Ask students to write a simple if-else statement for the scenario.
   - Share a few examples and discuss the logic behind them.

5. **Interactive Whiteboard Activity:**
   - Display a partially completed if-else block on the interactive whiteboard with a missing condition or action.
   - Invite students to come up and fill in the missing part.
   - Discuss why the completed block makes sense.

6. **Quick Role-Play:**
   - Assign roles to a few students to act out an if-else statement (e.g., if the student is wearing a blue shirt, they stand up; else, they sit down).
   - Quickly cycle through a few conditions.
   - Use this physical activity to emphasize the decision-making process in if-else statements.

7. **Flash Card Review:**
   - Prepare flashcards with simple if-else code snippets on one side and a brief explanation or outcome on the other.
   - Show the code side to students and ask them to predict the outcome.
   - Flip the card to reveal the correct answer and discuss.

8. **Peer Teaching:**
   - Pair students up and have them explain an if-else statement they’ve written or encountered to each other.
   - Encourage them to ask questions and clarify any doubts within the pair.
   - After a few minutes, ask some pairs to share what they discussed.

These activities are designed to be quick, engaging, and effective in reinforcing students' understanding of if-else blocks in a fun and interactive way.
