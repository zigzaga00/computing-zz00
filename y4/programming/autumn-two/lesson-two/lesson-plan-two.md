# Lesson Sequence: Developing a Chatbot in Scratch

## Overview
This sequence of three lessons will guide students in developing a chatbot in Scratch that answers questions on a specific subject. The project will help them understand how to use a sequence of independent if statements followed by a final if-else block. Each lesson will last one hour.

### Lesson 2: Expanding the Chatbot with More Questions and Final If-Else Block

**Objective:** Students will learn how to handle unexpected questions using a final if-else block.

**Materials:**
- Computers with Scratch installed
- Example [developed chatbot](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1043339463/)
- Scratch projects from Lesson 1

**Activities:**

1. **Review (10 minutes):**
   - Review how to use if-else blocks - please see [example review activities](review.md).
   - Discuss why a final if-else block might be necessary | we need to catch unexpected questions or questions which used unexpected words.

2. **Implementing the Final If-Else Block (10 minutes):**
   - Demonstrate how to add a final if-else block to handle unexpected questions | use the video in the shared area if not confident ðŸ˜ƒ

4. **Practice (35 minutes):**
   - Allow students to add the final if-else block.
   - Once this has been achieved the children can add more if blocks to answer different questions - ie they develop their chatbots to make them better.

5. **Plenary (5 minutes):**
   - The children explain to another pair or child what they have added to their projects and why.

**Differentiation:**
- **Less Confident Programmers:** Work with them to ensure their independent if statements are correct before adding the final if-else block.
- **Average Ability Programmers:** Encourage them to think of more varied questions and responses.
- **More Confident Programmers:** Challenge them to make the chatbot more personal by including the users name | they will need to use the `join` block for this | let them know about it but then let them work out how to use it by themselves
